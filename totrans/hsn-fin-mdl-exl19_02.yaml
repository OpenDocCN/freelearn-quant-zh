- en: If you asked five professionals the meaning of financial modeling, you would
    probably get five different answers. The truth is that they would all be correct
    in their own context. This is inevitable since the boundaries for the use of financial
    modeling continue to be stretched almost daily, and new users want to define the
    discipline from their own perspective. In this chapter, you will learn the basic
    ingredients of a financial model and what my favorite definitions are. You will
    also learn about the different tools for financial modeling that currently exist
    in the industry, as well as those features of Excel that make it the ideal tool
    to use in order to handle the various needs of a financial model.

    monetary terms. This could be the option that generates the highest returns, the
    least cost option, the option that carries an acceptable level of risk, and the
    most environmentally friendly option, but is usually a mixture of all these features. Inevitably,
    there is an inherent uncertainty in the situation, which makes it necessary to
    make assumptions based on past results. The most appropriate way to capture all
    the variables inherent in the situation or problem is to create a mathematical
    model. The model will establish relationships between the variables and assumptions,
    which serve as an input to the model. This model will include a series of calculations
    to evaluate the input information and to clarify and present the various alternatives
    and their consequences. It is this model that is referred to as a financial model.

    in an hour, 24 hours in a day, and so on to weeks, months and years. Excel knows
    the days of the week, months of the year, and their abbreviations, for example,
    Wed for Wednesday, Aug for August, and 03 for March! Excel even knows which months
    have 30 days, which months have 31 days, which years have 28 days in February,
    and which are leap years and have 29 days. It can differentiate between numbers
    and text, it also knows that you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers,
    and we can arrange text in alphabetical order. On the foundation of this human-like
    understanding of these parameters, Excel has built an amazing array of features
    and functions that allow the user to extract almost unimaginable detail from an
    array of data.'

    capacity, most models will be limited only by your imagination and appetite. This
    can make your model unwieldy and difficult to navigate. Excel is wealthy in navigation
    tools and shortcuts, it makes the process less stressful and even enjoyable. The
    following are examples of some of the navigation tools:'
