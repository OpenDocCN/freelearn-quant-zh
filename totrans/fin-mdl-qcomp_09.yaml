    the bridge between them and quantum hardware hasn’t been finished. Software applications
    should be that bridge to connect the two worlds. According to a report by Zapata
    Computing, 74% of respondents agree that companies that don’t adopt quantum computing
    solutions will fall behind soon. Additionally, 29% of respondents are already
    in the early or advanced stages of adopting quantum computing, and another 40%

    quantum computing is how to integrate them into their current operations. Depending
    on the case, the technology of real quantum hardware can be more or less prepared
    for real-time response and coexist with the current systems that the companies
    have deployed in the cloud. Particularly in the QML field, for classification
    challenges (credit scoring or fraud prediction), the instant response from a QC
    could be an issue to solve, since most of the machines have a queue system due
    to the small number of computers available. As a valid option, companies can use
    several types of simulators in the cloud to operate in a low range of qubits (most
    of the hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for QML operate quite well with a few
    tens of qubits) below the 40-qubit line.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The use of simulators can represent a good cost-efficient option, since the
    quantum algorithms can run faster (in the case of a small number of qubits), are
    cheaper, can respond in a real-time manner, and can do so without errors (depending
    on the setup and the parameters that the user wants to apply). The training process
    of QML models in a real quantum computer can take days to finish due to queue
    waiting times for each job or training iteration, compared with a simulator that,
    for the same challenge, could take a couple of hours.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another advantage of using simulators is that the software will be ready in
    any case for future improvements with the quantum computers since most of the
    quantum SDKs (e.g., Qiskit or PennyLane) can handle the change of *backends* easily.
    So, switching between simulators and official quantum hardware can be as simple
    as adapting a couple of lines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and easiest to use are the ones integrated into well-known clouds. AWS Braket,
    Azure Quantum, Google (Quantum AI), and IBM Quantum are the most straightforward
    to be used since they are available under classical companies’ infrastructure.
    In Amazon Web Services, the braket_sv, braket_dm, SV1, DM1, and TN1 simulators
    can be found; in IBM, statevector, stabilizer, extended stabilizer, MPS, and QASM.
    Google also has an interesting approach, providing qsim (an optimized quantum
    circuit simulator) and the **Quantum Virtual Machine** (**QVM**), which emulates
    a Google quantum computer. Depending on the type of simulator, users can execute

    problem, the Transverse Field Ising model, and little by little, modifies its
    shape toward a target problem known to be more complicated. The overall idea is
    that if the machine starts with the solution of a simpler problem and we slowly
    change its shape towards a more complicated one, at the end of the process, the
    machine will have evolved from the solution for an easy problem to one of the
    complicated problems that users need to be solved.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given that the machine is already encoded to follow that procedure, the user
    interacting with it would only be required to provide a target problem so that
    the D-Wave’s machine can produce its magic. This is the case, for example, with
    the portfolio optimization problem. By providing a mathematical description of
    how the assets in our portfolio interact with one another, the D-Wave machine
    is meant to follow that process.

    The trick here is that it is quantum-inspired, meaning that classical computing
    technology is used following quantum-inspired processes (such as the quantum annealing
    one) but, as it happens with quantum simulators above, makes this technology available
    to a broader audience and in most of the cases much more cost-effective.
