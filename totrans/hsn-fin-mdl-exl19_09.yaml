    complete except for the effects of **capital expenditure** (**CapEx**)—purchase,
    disposal and depreciation, long-term debt, fresh issues, repayments, and interest
    charges. The fixed asset, depreciation, and debt schedules are very important
    to our model as they tend to appear as very significant amounts in financial statements.
    These are long-term balances and are not covered by growth drivers. You will rely
    on the client to give you information about their plans for CapEx and debt for
    over the next five years. If you have no information on this, you will generally
    assume that the existing balances will continue to be serviced for the duration
    of the projected years, or until they are fully written down or off—whichever
    comes first.

- en: Our subject matter is referred to as long-term assets, fixed assets, and property
    plant and equipment. An asset is a long-term asset that the company will derive
    economic value from by using it for over a period of more than one year. This
    period is called the **useful life** of the asset. It would be unfair to charge
    the entire cost of such an asset in the period in which it was acquired; instead,
    the cost should be spread over the useful life of the asset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This annual allocation of cost is a measure of the decrease in value of a fixed
    asset, through its use or the effluxion of time. This is called **depreciation**.
    It is usually expressed as a percentage and is charged to the profit and loss
    account for each year. The reduction in the value of the fixed asset is reflected
    in the balance sheet, where the total **accumulated depreciation** is deducted
    from the original cost and charged to date. This is referred to as the **net book
    value**.

- en: If management decides that a useful service can be extracted from a fixed asset
    over a period of 10 years, then the cost of the asset will be spread over 10 years.
    The simplest way of doing this is to allocate the cost of the asset evenly over
    10 years, in order to arrive at a fixed annual charge or depreciation rate of
    10%. This is referred to as the **straight line method** (**SLM**) of depreciation.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another method of calculating depreciation is called the **reducing balance
    method**. This method is based on the assumption that an asset loses value more
    quickly in earlier years. It is therefore constructed to allocate more depreciation
    in the early years and less in the later years of an asset's useful life. In the
    first year of depreciation, the depreciation rate is applied to the cost of the
    asset. In subsequent years, the depreciation rate is applied to the net book value
    brought forward from the previous year.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    will also reduce because the depreciation rate is being applied to a progressively

    down to their residual value, so that in the final year of depreciation, the depreciation

    the components of fixed assets—the costs of the assets, additions, disposals,
    depreciation, and accumulated depreciation. Your discussions with management will
    give you an idea of their CapEx plans over the next five years. Where there is
    a disposal or sale, a fixed asset has to be removed from the books. The net book
    value (accumulated depreciation) of that asset will be transferred to a disposal
    account as a debit and the proceeds of the sale will be transferred to the same
    account as a credit. The difference between the two will either be a profit—where
    the **s****ale's proceeds** exceed the net book value—or a loss—where the net
    book value is greater than the sale's proceeds—on the disposal of assets and will
    be transferred from this disposal account to the profit and loss account at the
    end of the period. The following diagrams show the different scenarios associated

    reasonable to assume that the share capital will remain the same, and that equity
    will only be affected by retained earnings. Thus, leverage ratio multiplied by
    equity will give us our debt. For interest, you simply apply the interest rate
    to the opening debt balance. This will avoid any circular references.

    However, the customer doesn't want any of the pre-made packages on offer and wants
    a customized loan for a specific tenure and amount. In such cases, the calculations
