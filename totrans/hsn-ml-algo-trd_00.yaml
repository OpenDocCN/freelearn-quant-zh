- en: The availability of diverse data has increased the demand for expertise in algorithmic
    trading strategies. With this book, you will select and apply **machine learning**
    (**ML**) to a broad range of data sources and create powerful algorithmic strategies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will start by introducing you to essential elements, such as evaluating
    datasets, accessing data APIs using Python, using Quandl to access financial data,
    and managing prediction errors. We then cover various machine learning techniques
    and algorithms that can be used to build and train algorithmic models using pandas,
    Seaborn, StatsModels, and sklearn. We will then build, estimate, and interpret
    AR(p), MA(q), and ARIMA (p, d, q) models using StatsModels. You will apply Bayesian
    concepts of prior, evidence, and posterior, in order to distinguish the concept
    of uncertainty using PyMC3\. We will then utilize NLTK, sklearn, and spaCy to
    assign sentiment scores to financial news and classify documents to extract trading
    signals. We will learn to design, build, tune, and evaluate feed forward neural
    networks, **recurrent neural networks** (**RNNs**), and **convolutional neural
    networks** (**CNNs**), using Keras to design sophisticated algorithms. You will
    apply transfer learning to satellite image data to predict economic activity.
    Finally, we will apply reinforcement learning for optimal trading results.
