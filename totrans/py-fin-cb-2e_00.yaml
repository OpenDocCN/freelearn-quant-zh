- en: In the last few years, we have seen spectacular growth in the field of data
    science. Almost every day there is some kind of new development, for example,
    a research paper announcing a new or improved machine learning or deep learning
    algorithm, or a new library for one of the most popular programming languages.

- en: In the past, many of those advances did not make it to mainstream media. But
    that is also changing rapidly. Some of the recent examples include the AlphaGo
    program beating the 18-time world champion at Go, using deep learning to generate
    realistic faces of humans that never existed, or the beautiful digital art created
    from a text caption using models such as DALL-E 2 or Stable Diffusion.

    is a language model with which we can engage in natural-sounding conversations.
    The model is able to keep track of past questions and follow up on them, admit
    its mistakes, or reject inappropriate requests. What is more, it is not only restricted
    to natural language, we can ask it to write actual code snippets in various programming
    languages.

    in virtually every industry. We can see it all around us, for example, the recommendations
    we get on Netflix or the emails we receive about an extra discount from an online
    shop that we have not used recently. As such, businesses all over the world employ
    AI to gain a competitive edge in the following ways:'

    Forbes reported that “70% of all financial services firms are using machine learning
    to predict cash flow events, fine-tune credit scores and detect fraud”. Additionally,
    various aspects of data science are also used for algorithmic trading, robo-advisory
    services, personalized banking, process automation, and more.

    the financial domain using modern Python libraries. As such, we try to reduce
    the amount of code that needs to be written by leveraging mature and “battle-tested”
    libraries used by professionals in many industries. While the book assumes some
    prior knowledge and does not explain all the concepts from the theoretical point
    of view, it provides relevant references that allow the readers to dive deeper
    into the topics.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is intended for data analysts, financial analysts, data scientists,
    or ML engineers who want to learn how to implement a broad range of tasks in a
    financial context. The book assumes that the readers have some understanding of
    financial markets and trading strategies. They should also be comfortable with
    using Python and its popular libraries oriented towards data science (for example,
    `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn`).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book will help readers to correctly use advanced approaches to data analysis
    within the financial domain, avoid potential pitfalls and common mistakes, and
    reach correct conclusions for the problems they might be trying to solve. Additionally,
    as the data science and financial fields are dynamically changing and expanding,
    the book contains references to academic papers and other relevant resources to
    broaden the understanding of the covered topics.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Acquiring Financial Data*, covers a few of the most popular sources
    of high-quality financial data, including Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq Data Link, Intrinio,
    and Alpha Vantage. It focuses on leveraging dedicated Python libraries and processing
    data for further analysis.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 2*, *Data Preprocessing*, describes various techniques used to preprocess
    data. It describes the crucial steps between obtaining the data and using it for
    building machine learning models or investigating trading strategies. As such,
    it covers topics such as converting prices to returns, adjusting them for inflation,
    imputing missing values, or aggregating trade data into various kinds of bars.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Visualizing Financial Time Series*, focuses on visualizing financial
    (and not only) time series data. By plotting the data, we can visually identify
    some patterns, such as trends, seasonality, and changepoints, which we can further
    confirm using statistical tests. The insights gathered at this point can lead
    to making better decisions while choosing the modeling approach.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Exploring Financial Time Series Data*, shows how to use various
    algorithms and statistical tests to automatically identify potential issues with
    time series data, such as the existence of outliers. Additionally, it covers analyzing
    data for the existence of trends or other patterns such as mean-reversion. Lastly,
    it explores the stylized facts of asset returns. Together, those concepts are
    crucial while working with financial data, as we want to make sure that the models/strategies
    we are building can accurately capture the dynamics of asset returns.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 5*, *Technical Analysis and Building Interactive Dashboards*, explains
    the basics of technical analysis in Python by showing how to calculate some of
    the most popular indicators and automatically recognize patterns in candlestick
    data. It also demonstrates how to create a Streamlit-based web app, which enables
    us to visualize and inspect the predefined TA indicators in an interactive fashion.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Time Series Analysis and Forecasting*, introduces the basics
    of time series modeling. It starts by looking into the building blocks of time
    series and how to separate them using various decomposition methods. Then, it
    covers the concept of stationarity, how to test for it, and how to achieve it
    in case the original series is not stationary. Lastly, it shows how to use two
    of the most widely used statistical approaches to time series modeling—the exponential
    smoothing methods and ARIMA class models.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 7*, *Machine Learning-Based Approaches to Time Series Forecasting*,
    starts by explaining different ways of validating time series models. Then, it
    provides an overview of feature engineering approaches. It also introduces a tool
    for automatic feature extraction which generates hundreds or thousands of features
    with a few lines of code. Furthermore, it explains the concept of reduced regression
    and how to use Meta’s popular Prophet algorithm. The chapter concludes with an
    introduction to one of the popular AutoML frameworks for time series forecasting.'

    allocation strategy, and on its basis, showing how to evaluate the performance
    of portfolios. Then it shows three different approaches to obtaining the efficient
