- en: In financial modeling, there is no one-size-fits-all. Financial models can vary
    widely in size, purpose, and complexity. A valuation model is vastly different
    from a loan repayment model. A model that's created to expand a business will
    be different from one that's created to dispose of a business. A model that's
    created to give someone a rough idea of the value of a business will be far less
    complex than one that's created in support of a private placement or an initial
    public offering of the shares of the business. It is imperative that you understand
    the scope and purpose of the model you have been asked to prepare. No matter how
    impressive your model is, it is of no use if it doesn't meet the requirements
    of the user. In this chapter, you will learn how to analyze projects and learn
    what the purpose of a project is. You will also learn how to create assumptions
    to improve our project.

    If, however, you decided not to withdraw the interest of N10m, but rather to compound
    it, you would have N100m + N10m = N110m to invest at 10% at the beginning of the
    second year. So, at the end of the second year, you would receive N11m in interest
    (10% of N110m). You would therefore have N110m + N11m = N121m to invest at 10%
    at the beginning of the third year, and so on.

    complete, except for depreciation and interest.

- en: '**Days of inventory**: We have mentioned that days of inventory is expected
    to be stable over the years. You could therefore take the average of historical
    days of inventory over the past five years and use this as the projected driver
    for inventory over the next five years. If there have been any occurrences that
    indicate that activity may be affected in such a way as to have a significant
    effect on COGS, you could apply a best-judgement adjustment to the average days
    of inventory calculated. For example, a big competitor entering into the market
    could result in a temporary slowdown in sales, thereby leading to a reduction
    in COGS and thus an increase in days of inventory.'

- en: In this chapter, we have seen that without thorough knowledge of the nature
    and purpose of a project, you could end up with a model that doesn't meet the
    specifications of your client. We have learned about the nature of and reason
    for assumptions, as well as the importance of discussions with management in projecting
    your assumptions into the future. In making our assumptions, we have realized
    the importance of historical financials, balance sheets, profit and loss accounts,
    and cash flow statements. We have also learned about historical financials, which
    are an essential starting point in resolving anomalies that may arise in our model.
