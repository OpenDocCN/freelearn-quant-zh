    without significant market impact, you do not own anything. It owns you. The way
    to approach liquidity on the short side is radically different. On the long side,
    liquidity increases as more investors are drawn to rising prices. Early birds
    end up selling to a much larger pool of market participants.

    street. After a beating, they don't come back for round two. Nothing captures
    the emotional journey of long market participants more faithfully than the Kübler-Ross
    model. Market participants grieve their losses. Each phase even has a distinctive
    signature on the markets. Interest wanes, and as the pool of market participants
    shrinks, so does liquidity. Early bear markets are a lot more liquid than later-stage
    ones. Short sellers exit into thinner liquidity than they entered.

    The last thing you want is to be caught in a short squeeze with a large position
    that you cannot cover without serious market impact. On the short side, the way
    to approach liquidity and market impact is not about how long it takes to build
    a position, but about how easy it is to get out.

    The resolution of the 2008 great financial crisis got the markets addicted to
    quantitative easing, otherwise known as free money. In layman's terms, monetary
    authorities flooded the world with painkillers to ease the pain of an economic
    crisis. As soon as monetary authorities hint at tapering off, markets spiral down
    in withdrawal, and traders flock to safer, more defensive stocks, which is known
    as "risk-off." This forces monetary cavalry to keep pumping more painkillers into
    the system, which sends all kinds of speculative assets deep into bubble territory.
    When risk is 'on' and traders are looking for riskier stocks with more profit
    potential, small-mid caps are where the action is happening. Meanwhile, on the
    short side, boring blue chips are out of style. Whenever there is no accountability
    for failure, there is no incentive to play safe. When risk is 'off', and market
    participants are investing more defensively, they gravitate toward larger capitalizations,
    where liquidity remains abundant. Reverting the long-small/short-large caps trade
    is not easy. Shorting small caps is a bloody sport. Liquidity evaporates, and
    you can dock a supertanker in the bid/ask spread. So, gains can be wiped out at
    the first squeeze.

    named "**squeeze box**." The mechanics might have been counterintuitive, but it
    had a surreal accuracy rate to predict potential short squeezes. All it took was
    a long-only manager to take a minuscule speculative long position. Since the buy/sell
    equilibrium was already out of balance, this would push the price up and flush
    the tourists out. They would frantically cover, which would rapidly morph into
    a short squeeze. At this point, the long-only manager would leisurely exit their
    long position with a comfortable profit. When I realised that this program directly
    hurt my friends back in the hedge fund world, this WMSD was permanently dismantled.

    are liquidating and ride their tails. Good short stories usually make up for bad
    short trades. Every bit of information has a tick price tag attached to it. Do
    not wait for all the pieces of the puzzle to fit. By the time a story has deteriorated
    enough to become an obvious short candidate, institutional investors will have
    liquidated their long positions. The only people left will be short sellers fighting
    over a dry bone. This leads us to a simple and powerful supply-and-demand indicator
    called **borrow utilization**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Borrow utilization is the ratio of borrow taken out for short selling divided
    by the supply of shares available for borrow. Large institutions have lending
    programs wherein they lend a portion of their long holdings for a fee. When they
    trim those positions, supply dries up.

    the numerator and supply on the denominator is what makes borrow utilization the
    most effective measure of both institutional ownership and popularity. For example,
    borrow utilization north of 50% simply means that the shorting appetite exceeds
    institutional ownership. Since institutions are the major players in the markets,
    the risk/reward ratio evidently deteriorates.
  prefs: []

    These range from **general collateral** (**GC**) on easy-to-borrow issues to prohibitive
    rates on hard-to-borrow or crowded shorts. As borrow gradually gets taken out,
    the quality of the remaining pool deteriorates. Adding to this, hard-to-borrow
    issues do not only fetch usury rates that would make Shakespeare's Shylock blush;
    they are sometimes callable. This means the lenders have the option of withdrawing
    their lending back on short notice. This is referred to as "**recall**." When
    recalls happen, short sellers are left to either locate borrow elsewhere or close
    their positions. Recalls sometimes cause short squeezes.

    effortlessly. This triggers other short sellers to stop losses, and they proceed
    to cover. This rapidly snowballs into a full-blown short squeeze that flushes

    to their share price. High dividend yield attracts value investors and retailers
    who look for more stable cash flow. This effectively deters short sellers from
    engaging in bear campaigns. However, while a high dividend yield might stem immediate
    short selling pressure, it does not prevent the share price from falling in the
    long term. A high dividend yield is usually synonymous with ex-growth companies.
    They have stopped growing, so they redistribute cash back to shareholders. This
    is what makes the high-yielding stock universe fertile ground for profitable,
    peaceful short selling.

    There are a few events that short sellers need to be mindful of. The first two

    moments. Companies sometimes decide to raise dividends around the time they make
    earnings announcements. Time your trading around those dates, and you will have
    a surprisingly pleasant time. For example, investors tend to reduce immediately
    past the ex-date, the moment when dividends are declared. This accentuates the
    drop into dividend payment date.

    management. Despite outstanding long-term collective track records, their aggregate
    AUM remains a rounding error. This is where it gets confusing for fund managers.
    On the one hand, investors openly say they are looking for returns. On the other
    hand, when it is time to put the money where their mouth is, they opt for something
    else. The good news is money leaves a trail.

    Any white-collar criminal who defrauds investors deserves decades behind bars.
    Bernard L. Madoff is a good contender for the greatest con artist of all time
    in the private sector minor league. He spent decades defrauding thousands of investors
    of billions of dollars. His tale offers a valuable insight into the mind of investors.

    of some of the most sophisticated players in the finance industry. In a rare interview
    from prison, Mr. Madoff confessed that investors "should have known better." Below
    is a table of Madoff''s alleged returns:'

    As previously mentioned, investors say they want returns, but they react to drawdowns.
    What set Madoff apart were four things:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'First, the duration of drawdowns: Never test the patience of investors. One
    of the questions lingering on the back of the mind of every investor from retailer
    to institutional asset allocator is: "Is it too late to invest?" Only when greed,
    or the fear of missing out, is stronger than the fear of losing money will they
    put their hard-earned savings to work. In practice, peak inflows often coincide
    with the top of bull runs. Patsies who subscribed to the "Dow at 36,000" charlatanism
    and took the plunge in August 2000 had to endure 80 consecutive months of drawdown
    before they could make their money back in May 2007\. That was just in time for
    the next dive. In contrast, Mr. Madoff was always open for business. He had only
    2 consecutive down months. Every month was a good month to get in. Such a small
    drawdown duration is statistically improbable. The only market participant who
    has ever come close is the legendary Edward Thorp, who ironically blew the whistle
    on Madoff 14 years before the scandal erupted.'

    in a drawdown, investors worry about how bad this could get. The markets might
    go up by 7% long-term average return, conveniently omitting the abysmal -40-50%
    drawdowns in between. Even though positive returns were not spectacular, the maximum
    drawdown of -1.56% made it look like a risk-free investment. Kahneman-Tversky
    formulated their prospect theory in a much more brilliant way: loss aversion is
    more powerful than profit-seeking. It illustrates a powerful concept: "It does
    not matter how much you make, as long as you don''t lose." Investors could set
    and forget.'

- en: 'Third is the frequency of drawdowns: Never test the nerves of investors. Madoff
    was supposedly up 92% of the time as opposed to 63% for the S&P. S&P had 6 years
    of annual returns above 20%. It also had 4 years of negative double-digit returns.
    In comparison, Madoff''s fraudulent average return was 11.04%. Yet, the compounded
    return of S&P was 200% versus 500% for Madoff.'

- en: Fourth is semi-correlation (correlation to down months of the S&P Index), or
    the ability to make money in down markets. At 3%, Madoff was allegedly up whenever
    the market was down. That one sealed the deal. Managers who still stand up when
    everyone else is down stand out. Their phones ring off the hook with interested
    investors.

    However, the closer you get, the more attractive your proposition becomes. If
    you manage to build a product somewhere between Madoff's Holy Grail and a passive
    investment in the index, you will get a serious edge over your competitors.

- en: This short chapter is not meant to test the braincells of the reader. It is
    simply a collection of practical tips on how to avoid classic expensive pitfalls
    and meet investors' expectations. Investors do not buy into long/short products
    for long ideas. They want low-volatility uncorrelated returns. This chapter considered
    investors' expectations, while avoiding the trap of thinking of the short book
    as an afterthought of the more fun long book. If those problem stocks are removed
    from your field of vision, they will not be on your mind and this will eliminate
    temptation.

    will put everything together, and see how this can be done in practice.
