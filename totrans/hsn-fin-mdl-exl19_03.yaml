    between actual performance and future results. Although you will need to project
    every single item in the model, your assumptions will focus on items that will
    have a material effect on the final results. Other non-material items can be projected
    as, say, percentage of turnover (for revenue items) or a best judgement figure
    (for balance sheet items).

    various schedules and worksheets to find what you need.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good way to ensure that your model is easy to follow, and use is to build
    a template (a standard format) with some simple rules guiding how data is to be
    input and presented. In general, you will require at least six columns of figures,
    three each of historical and projected years, and another three or four columns
    for descriptive information. The template should enhance navigation and be easy
    to follow. The first major decision is whether to adopt a single worksheet or
    multiple worksheet approach.

    is dedicated to one statement. So, you have assumptions, balance sheet, profit
    and loss, cash flow statements, and so on, all on separate worksheets. This means
    that you will end up with 10 or more worksheets. The following screenshot gives
    an indication of the multiple tabs required in this approach:'

    sheet, you know that everything on the balance sheet worksheet relates to the
    balance sheet alone. There is no ambiguous content on the worksheet. If you then
    need to modify or query the content of that worksheet, you can do so without having
    to consider whether or not you are affecting a statement other than the balance
    sheet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to facilitate efficient navigation through your model, you should ensure
    that each year is in the same column on each worksheet. So that, if the `Y05F`
    year is in column **J** on the balance sheet worksheet, it should be in column
    **J** on the profit and loss, cash flow, and all other worksheets.

- en: '**Single worksheet approach**: In order to follow this approach, you must ensure
    that you maintain a standard layout for all statements right from the outset.
    Any change to column width or attempts to insert or delete columns will affect
    all statements since they are stacked one on top of the other. An important part
    of this approach is the grouping of each statement. Excel allows you to group
    rows so that they can be collapsed and hidden or expanded and revealed by clicking
    the **–** or **+** that is displayed alongside the row labels when the group is
    created. The following screenshot is an example of the single worksheet approach:'

    group. The collapse or expand button is displayed at the end of the line, just
    after the last row of the group. It appears as a **–** sign when the group is
    expanded. Clicking the **–** sign will collapse the group and turn the sign to
    a **+** sign. You click the **+** sign if you wish to expand the group.

    With historical data, we are interested in the balance sheet, profit and loss
    account, and cash flow statement. It is common, in the course of preparing financial
    statements, to have a number of initial drafts which may have content that will
    been superseded when the final statements are agreed. Ensure that the financials
    you are given are the final audited financial statements. The more information
    you have, the more accurate your projections. However, you must not get carried
    away, as too much information will make the model unnecessarily cumbersome. Generally,
    historical data is limited to five years, with another five years of projected
    financials. Try to get soft copies of the historical financials in Excel readable
    format, as this will significantly reduce the amount of time you will need to
    spend converting into your template format.

    the historical financials will not change as you create your model; however, more
    often than not, you would have obtained the financials from a source that works
    with different preferences and priorities to yours. Moreover, the financials were
    not prepared with you and your financial model in mind. Imported data is therefore
    riddled with formatting or presentation anomalies, which make it difficult and
    sometimes impossible to utilize some Excel tools and shortcuts. This makes it
