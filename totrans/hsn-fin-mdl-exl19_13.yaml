    order to reduce the effects of this subjectivity as much as possible, you will
    need to adopt certain procedures, some of which we have already mentioned, and
    carry out certain tests designed to highlight the most volatile assumptions and
    pay direct attention to those inputs to which the model is most sensitive.

    a value for equity share price. As a result of the uncertainty inherent in your

- en: In the scenario we are creating, we are generating random probabilities and
    we wish to convert these to values for both FCFF growth and WACC. To do this,
    we use the Excel function, `NORMINV`. This function uses the mean, standard deviation,
    and probability to calculate a value for the `growth in FCFF` and `WACC` variables.

    *F2* (**Edit**), and then *Enter*. Each time new random numbers are generated,
    new values are created for FCFF growth and WACC.

    in order to tabulate the results. We would have to do this 100 times to cover
    the number of simulations required by the scenario we are building. Alternatively,
    there is a much more efficient way to do this, using data tables.

- en: In this chapter, we have learned how to incorporate into your model a number
    of tests and procedures in order to improve the accuracy of the model. We have
    learned a number of basic procedures to follow in order to troubleshoot where
    errors are revealed in your model. We have understood the meaning of sensitivity
    analysis and learned how to use the direct and indirect methods. We have also
    learned how to display our results in a chart and to interpret them meaningfully.
    Finally, we learned about scenario analysis, how it differs from sensitivity analysis,
    and how to use it.
