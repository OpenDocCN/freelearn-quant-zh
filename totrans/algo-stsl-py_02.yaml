  zh: 10个关于卖空的经典神话
- en: Since the 1975 movie *Jaws*, whenever we get in the water, we all have this
    instinctive apprehension about what swims beneath. Sharks are unparalleled killing
    machines. They have a better detection system than the most technologically advanced
    sonar. They swim faster than speed boats. They have three rows of razor-sharp
    teeth that continuously regrow. Yet, did you know that deep in the comfort of
    your home, somewhere in the dark, there is something a thousand times deadlier
    than any great white? There are, on average, 80 shark attacks every year, mostly
    exploratory bites and mistaken identity. Meanwhile, falling out of bed carries
    a far greater probability. Sharks are majestic creatures. If they wanted us dead,
    we would be. Apparently, they don't like junk food.

    versus passive investing debate. Active management refers to fund managers taking
    bets away from the benchmark, a practice referred to as active money. Passive
    investing refers to minimizing the tracking error by mimicking the index. Active
    managers claim their stock-picking ability and portfolio management skills deliver
    superior returns. However, the numbers tell a different story. According to S&P's
    *Index versus Active* reports, the vast majority of active managers underperform
    the S&P 500 benchmark on 1, 3, and 5 year-horizons. This means that their cumulative
    compounded returns are lower than the benchmark. **Exchange-Traded Funds**, or
    **ETFs**, fared better than active managers every year on record, even during
    the most severe market downturns.

  zh: 与主动投资和被动投资辩论相比，没有什么比“故事与数字”二分法更能说明问题。主动管理指的是基金经理将押注从基准中抽走的做法，这被称为主动资金。被动投资是指通过模仿指数来最小化跟踪误差。主动管理者声称他们的选股能力和投资组合管理技能可以提供优异的回报。然而，数字讲述了一个不同的故事。根据标普的《指数对比主动》报告，在1年、3年和5年的时间跨度上，绝大多数主动管理者的表现都不如标普500指数基准。这意味着他们的累积复合回报低于基准。**交易所交易基金**，或**ETFs**，在每年的记录中表现比主动管理者更好，甚至在最严重的市场下跌期间也是如此。

    active managers to prove that they can deliver more than the index. The debate
    has gradually shifted from "which manager should we allocate to?" to "remind me

    when there is a liquid, better, cheaper alternative?"

- en: 'Unfortunately, there is more. The penalty for deviating from the benchmark
    is severe. If managers deviate and outperform, they are knighted as "stock pickers."
    Yet, when they stray and underperform, they are dubbed as having "high tracking
    errors." This often leads to redemptions, the kiss of death for fund managers.
    When the choice is between becoming a hero or keeping your job, self-preservation
    compels active managers to mirror the benchmark, a practice referred to as **closet
    indexing**. This is the famous "*no-one ever got fired for holding [insert big
    safe blue-chip stock here…]*" line. If active managers end up mirroring their
    benchmark, then the "active versus passive" debate is a misnomer. It really comes
    down to a choice between low-cost indexing via an index fund versus expensive
    closet indexing via a self-preserving active manager. Either way, you get the
    same index, but with the latter, you also have to pay a middle-man, called an
    active manager. As John Boggle, founder of Vanguard, used to say: "*in investing,
    you get what you don''t pay for*."'

    are exceptional active managers worth every penny of their management fees. It
    simply means that the average active mutual fund manager gives active management
    a bad name. Investors who go down the active management route not only take an
    equity risk premium. They also take an active management risk premium. The current
    crisis of active management is nothing but the time-honored routine of the middle
    man in every industry who realizes that they can no longer delay efficiency.

    So, in theory, you should stay invested for the long run. Explain that again to
    the cohorts who retired in 2001 and 2009\. Markets have gone down 50% twice in
    a decade. When the response to "too big to fail" and "too much leverage" was to
    make them bigger, hyper-leverage, and put the same people responsible for the

    numbers instead of stories, then passive investing is the way to go on the long

- en: Another counter-intuitive conclusion for practitioners is evolution. Active
    fund managers face an unprecedented existential crisis. If they want to survive,

    is value, the other is valuation. Intrinsic value is the net wealth companies
    create through the sale of products and services. Market value is the price market
    participants are willing to pay. Market and intrinsic value live in parallel universes
    that rarely intersect. One is hard work. The other is the fabled Keynesian beauty

    bad breath, colorful language, and small positions relative to the overall float,
    then faith in capitalism should join the great white shark and polar bear in the
    list of endangered species. The national sport of short sellers is to unveil paradoxes
    in the fabric of the corporate space-time continuum. Ignorance and competence
    cannot exist in the same place at the same time. Basically, you cannot pretend
    to know what you are doing if you don't know what is going on. Strangely enough,
    this is a lie embattled CEOs would like us to believe. Whenever they are questioned
    about the illicit activities of their subordinates, their first line of defense
    is to feign indignation and throw them under the Bentley, pretending that they
    were unaware of the illicit actions perpetrated by a few isolated rogue individuals.

    their underlings, either they are willfully blind and therefore complicit in the
    cover-up, or they really do not know what is going on and therefore incompetent.
    Either way, they are unfit for duty and undeserving of their compensation packages.
    That explains why, whenever short sellers uncover malfeasance, top management
    goes on the offensive and portrays short sellers as evil speculators who spread
    vicious unfounded rumors. Companies who have nothing to fear may not be happy,

- en: Market participants sell short for various reasons. Options traders, convertible
    managers, and indexers need to delta-hedge their positions. The inability to sell
    short reduces liquidity and the offering of financial products. Restrictions on
    short selling are therefore a sign of market immaturity.

- en: Short sellers simply do not have the firepower to torpedo share prices. Short
    sellers need to borrow shares in order to sell short. This comes from shareholders
    who lend a fraction of their holdings to stock loan desks. Borrow availability
    usually averages less than 10% of the free float, in other words, the portion
    of shares available to public investors. This means that short sellers represent
    a fraction of the overall sell volume.

- en: The BB guns of short sellers may have a punctual market impact, but the real
    damage is inflicted by the heavy artillery of institutional investors selling.
    This leads us to an interesting point about short selling. Making money on the
    short side is not about spotting stocks that could potentially go down. It is
    about riding the tail of institutional investors liquidating their positions.

    lament the scarcity of "good short ideas." Besides, they do not want to trail
    their competitors by wasting precious alpha shorting stocks. They procrastinate

    selling is an unprofessional way to manage other people's money. Short selling
    is a muscle that atrophies when not flexed.

- en: Now, they do not hold reciprocal beliefs about their longs. Of course, they
    believe they require continuous maintenance. They believe in meeting with management,
    updating earnings models, calls with analysts, and so on. So, they believe in

    real world, everyone knows that the short side is considerably harder than the
    long. So, how come complacent laziness would work on the difficult side when hard
    work barely pays off on the easy one?

    more books and whitepapers published in relation to modern techniques such as
    artificial intelligence or machine learning than short selling, which has been
