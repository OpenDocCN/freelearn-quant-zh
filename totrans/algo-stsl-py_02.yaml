- en: Since the 1975 movie *Jaws*, whenever we get in the water, we all have this
    instinctive apprehension about what swims beneath. Sharks are unparalleled killing
    machines. They have a better detection system than the most technologically advanced
    sonar. They swim faster than speed boats. They have three rows of razor-sharp
    teeth that continuously regrow. Yet, did you know that deep in the comfort of
    your home, somewhere in the dark, there is something a thousand times deadlier
    than any great white? There are, on average, 80 shark attacks every year, mostly
    exploratory bites and mistaken identity. Meanwhile, falling out of bed carries
    a far greater probability. Sharks are majestic creatures. If they wanted us dead,
    we would be. Apparently, they don't like junk food.

    and not as deadly as you might think. You know you have a bit of a reputational
    issue when your brethren, in allegedly the most reviled industry, would still
    gladly sharpen pitchforks at the single mention of your profession. In this chapter,
    we will debunk 10 of the most enduring myths surrounding short selling:'

    encouraged market participants to buy stocks to "shore up the market." They claimed
    it was "the patriotic thing to do." I grew up in an era when patriots were altruistic
    individuals who put their lives at risk so that others may have a better future.

    at risk in order to guarantee an end-of-year bonus and ego massage.

    nor were they responsible for its collapse. Their crime was to do their homework,

    then let's have a look at them.

- en: Nothing illustrates the "story versus numbers" dichotomy better than the active
    versus passive investing debate. Active management refers to fund managers taking
    bets away from the benchmark, a practice referred to as active money. Passive
    investing refers to minimizing the tracking error by mimicking the index. Active
    managers claim their stock-picking ability and portfolio management skills deliver
    superior returns. However, the numbers tell a different story. According to S&P's
    *Index versus Active* reports, the vast majority of active managers underperform
    the S&P 500 benchmark on 1, 3, and 5 year-horizons. This means that their cumulative
    compounded returns are lower than the benchmark. **Exchange-Traded Funds**, or
    **ETFs**, fared better than active managers every year on record, even during
    the most severe market downturns.

    benchmarks can be accessed via S&P''s SPIVA reports: [https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/spiva/#/reports/regions](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/spiva/#/reports/regions).'

    active managers to prove that they can deliver more than the index. The debate
    has gradually shifted from "which manager should we allocate to?" to "remind me
    again why we should be going with an expensive underperforming benchmark hugger
    when there is a liquid, better, cheaper alternative?"
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is severe. If managers deviate and outperform, they are knighted as "stock pickers."
    Yet, when they stray and underperform, they are dubbed as having "high tracking
    errors." This often leads to redemptions, the kiss of death for fund managers.
    When the choice is between becoming a hero or keeping your job, self-preservation
    compels active managers to mirror the benchmark, a practice referred to as **closet
    indexing**. This is the famous "*no-one ever got fired for holding [insert big
    safe blue-chip stock here…]*" line. If active managers end up mirroring their
    benchmark, then the "active versus passive" debate is a misnomer. It really comes
    down to a choice between low-cost indexing via an index fund versus expensive
    closet indexing via a self-preserving active manager. Either way, you get the
    same index, but with the latter, you also have to pay a middle-man, called an
    active manager. As John Boggle, founder of Vanguard, used to say: "*in investing,
    you get what you don''t pay for*."'

    are exceptional active managers worth every penny of their management fees. It
    simply means that the average active mutual fund manager gives active management
    a bad name. Investors who go down the active management route not only take an
    equity risk premium. They also take an active management risk premium. The current
    crisis of active management is nothing but the time-honored routine of the middle
    man in every industry who realizes that they can no longer delay efficiency.

    between 6.3% and 8% on average. Compounded returns over a century are astronomical.
    So, in theory, you should stay invested for the long run. Explain that again to
    the cohorts who retired in 2001 and 2009\. Markets have gone down 50% twice in
    a decade. When the response to "too big to fail" and "too much leverage" was to
    make them bigger, hyper-leverage, and put the same people responsible for the
    GFC back in the driver''s seat, rest assured that markets are bound to hit "soft
    patches" again. Long-only active managers may display heroic grace under fire
    during bear markets but, when your net worth has gone down by 50%, a 1 or 2% outperformance
    is a rounding error. Two double diamond black slopes in a decade and everyone
    wants bear market insurance: "What should I buy during a bear market?"'

    any sense, then why would you buy anything during a bear market? There is no safe
    harbor asset class that will magically rise. The only thing that goes up in a
    bear market is correlation. There will be ample time to buy at bargain-basement
    prices once the rain of falling knives stops.'

    rate of return are those whose mandate is inversely correlated with the index.
    These people are short sellers. You do not have to like them. You do not even
    have to stay invested with them during bull markets. More than any other market
    participants, they understand the cyclicality of inflows and redemptions. If you
    choose to retire on numbers, then you owe your pension to consider allocating
    to short sellers.
  prefs: []

    numbers instead of stories, then passive investing is the way to go on the long
    side. For capital protection and alpha generation during downturns, investors
    need to allocate to short sellers. In the active management space, the only market
    participants who will deliver a reasonable rate of return on your pension are
    short sellers.

    fund managers face an unprecedented existential crisis. If they want to survive,
    they need to evolve, adapt, and acquire new skills. Short selling might very well
    be a rare skill uniquely suited to market participants who are determined to stay
    relevant.

    risk committee and boards of directors at Lehman Brothers doing? Nothing. They
    did strictly nothing to prevent or remedy the situation because none of them ever

    into the ground. Kay Whitmore buried Kodak. The responsibility for Bears Stearns,
    Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and AIG falls squarely on the shoulders of those

    Steve Jobs in his 1995 Lost Interview. He mentioned that "groupthink" amidst the
    rarefied atmosphere of top management in venerable institutions sometimes leads
    to a cognitive bias called the Dunning-Kruger effect. As an example, Kodak was
    once an iconic brand. Management believed they were so ahead of the game they
    could indefinitely delay innovation. They took a step backward to their old core
    technology when the world was moving forward. As tragic as it was back then, there
    is no flower on Kodak's grave today. The world, and even the 50,000 Kodak employees

    cavalry. The cruel lesson is that evolution does not take prisoners. Out of the
    hundreds of car manufacturers between the two world wars emerged a few winners.
    The rest of the industry went out of business. For every winner, there are countless
    losers. Today, everyone is perfectly happy with horse-carts running around Central

    or been merged into larger companies. Radio Shack did not go out of business because

    the competition of Amazon and the likes of Best Buy. Short sellers do not destroy
    companies. They escort obsolescence out of the inexorable march of evolution.

    bad breath, colorful language, and small positions relative to the overall float,

    in the fabric of the corporate space-time continuum. Ignorance and competence
    cannot exist in the same place at the same time. Basically, you cannot pretend
    to know what you are doing if you don't know what is going on. Strangely enough,
    this is a lie embattled CEOs would like us to believe. Whenever they are questioned
    about the illicit activities of their subordinates, their first line of defense
    is to feign indignation and throw them under the Bentley, pretending that they
    were unaware of the illicit actions perpetrated by a few isolated rogue individuals.

    with impunity. So, when CEOs claim they are not aware of fraud perpetrated by
    their underlings, either they are willfully blind and therefore complicit in the
    cover-up, or they really do not know what is going on and therefore incompetent.
    Either way, they are unfit for duty and undeserving of their compensation packages.
    That explains why, whenever short sellers uncover malfeasance, top management

    should do is revisit their bullish stance. Short sellers are often blamed for
    spreading vicious rumors and profiting from the decline. Companies will take analysts
    with Buy ratings for dinner and short sellers to court. Short sellers must therefore
    be careful about their facts and wording. Secondly, regulators do not take kindly

    does not infuriate corporations, quite the opposite in fact. Every start up entrepreneur
    in Silicon Valley knows that markets have only two seasons, bull and bear. A bull
    market is series A and IPO season. A bear market is "go back working for the man"
    season. Executives in defensive sectors, such as food or utilities, do not expect
    their stocks to be assets of choice during bull markets. In fact, they would probably
    rescind their pension mandate to a manager who would gulp up their stock in a
    bull market, unless of course you are Warren Buffett and you talk to Coca-Cola.

    They salivate over the story. When a recall happens, they scramble to locate.
    When no borrow is available, they are forced to cover, which eventually snowballs
    into short squeezes.

    Market participants are not risk-averse when they choose not to learn the craft.
    They are conservative to the point of being risk-seeking. Think of it as emergency
    drills. A refusal to practice the drills does not make the risks of fire, tsunami,
    or earthquake go away. People choose to go about their business unprepared for
    rare but life-threatening events. Being a market participant is not just about

    let's look inside and play a game. Pick two pieces of paper, draw two columns.
    On the first one, write down your fears about bear markets. What is going to happen
    to your gains, portfolio, net worth, and job? How do you prepare for it? Be specific
    about when and how it manifests in your daily work. For example, do you check
    the markets more often than you think you should? Do you scan news for potentially
    bearish catalysts? Are you overly conservative or do you take risky bets while
    you think you can?

    of their corner offices. The banking lobby promptly marched up to Washington to
    demand a moratorium on short selling. In response, the U.S. **Securities and Exchange
    Commission** (**SEC**) put a temporary ban on short selling in the country in
    an effort to "restore equilibrium to the markets." This was lifted a short time
    later. Once the dust had settled, some analysis was done on the effect of the
    short selling ban, and the Federal Reserve published a report in which they concluded

    a downgrade of U.S. debt. Our cross-sectional tests suggest that the decline in
    stock prices was not significantly driven or amplified by short selling. Short
    selling does not appear to be the root cause of recent stock market declines.
    Furthermore, banning short selling does not appear to prevent stock prices from
    falling when firm-specific or economy-wide economic fundamentals are weak, and

    sellers need to borrow shares in order to sell short. This comes from shareholders
    who lend a fraction of their holdings to stock loan desks. Borrow availability
    usually averages less than 10% of the free float, in other words, the portion
    of shares available to public investors. This means that short sellers represent
    a fraction of the overall sell volume.

    about riding the tail of institutional investors liquidating their positions.
