    finance in the statistical language R. This book has been written with the intention
    of passing knowledge to people who are interested in learning quantitative finance
    with R. In this book, we have covered various topics, ranging from basic level
    to advance level. In particular, we have covered statistical, time series, and
    wavelet analysis along with their applications in algorithmic trading. We have
    also done our best to explain some applications of machine learning, risk management,
    optimization, and option pricing in this book.'

- en: First of all, you should make sure that R is installed on your machine. All
    the examples in this book have been implemented in R and can be executed on the
    R console.  R is an open source platform and can be installed free of charge for
    any operating system from [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/).
    Installation guidelines are also found on this website. Once you have R on your
    machine, you can straightaway go to [chapter 1](part0015_split_000.html#page "Chapter 1. 
    Introduction to R") and  start. Each chapter explains about the required packages,
    shows how to install packages, and and tells the reader how to load them into
    the workspace.

- en: This book is written with the intent to pass knowledge to people who are interested
    in learning R and its application in analytics. However, we have covered examples
    from finance.  This book covers basic to complex finance examples, along with
    varying degrees of complexity of R coding. This book does not expect you to have
    prior R programming knowledge, however this expects you to have little bit knowledge
    of mathematical analytical concepts. Even if you are well versed with R, this
    book can still be of great help to you as it explains various live examples from
    the data analytics industry, in particular, capital markets.
