    were alive again! In late January 2006, the police raided the party, literally.
    They arrested the poster child of this new-Japan paradigm. And suddenly, it felt
    like a nightclub closing. Crude neon lights were suddenly switched on. Haggard
    drunk people were staring at each other on the dance floor, confused and disoriented.
    Reality was back with a vengeance. The levitating zombies had rediscovered Newtonian
    physics. Unfortunately, the availability and cost of borrow on any single issue
    was dissuasive, so with my buddies on the Merrill Lynch stock lending desk, we
    came up with a **Credit Rating Asset Price** (**CRAP**) basket-swap idea. We dumped
    in all the zombies we could find. The cost of borrow was an affordable 2%. The
    price would be end of day closing price. Capacity was virtually unlimited. At
    a composite beta of 2.3, it had far more torque than index futures. We were in
    business.

    he was not comfortable with the trade. After three weeks, I concluded that exotic
    is a holiday destination, not a short position in a three-quarter of a billion-dollar
    portfolio. Then, one day, the swap got in. It had my name on it too. I couldn''t
    sleep that night. The next day, it tanked an additional -2%. The day after that,
    it fell another -0.5%, but then, it started to stabilise. It went up +0.5%, +3%,
    +6%. We had perfectly timed the bottom. But now, the mother of all short squeezes
    was bringing democracy to short-sellers. Eventually, we closed the position with
    a large loss on a short instrument that had come down -63% in less than 2 months.'

    Besides, there is already embedded P&L from prior positions. Consolidated open
    risk is therefore lower than any new entry. This has limitations, however. Adding
    to an existing position is called **pyramiding**. Like everything in life, trends
    mature. Every new position is taken closer to the maturity—and eventually the
    exhaustion—of a trend. This increases concentration risk and volatility. It is

    for each re-entry. Position sizes will eventually be too small and rejected.

    revenge traders. Deep down, they are angry at their shadow selves for not participating

    altogether. Either way, they vent their frustration by putting other people's
    precious money in immediate harm's way on the short side. Behind the adult call

    demanding justice for that rude price. Either way, other people's money is not

    used to whine about short squeezes. I would enter a position, feel good, and then
    be unceremoniously stopped out at the next bear market rally. The financial capital
    suffers injury and the emotional capital suffers yet another insult. More importantly,
    it seemed like the lesson was lost. Then one day, the energy of a short squeeze
    dawned upon the density of my intellect. Since price seemed to rally beyond my
    "line in the sand" stop loss anyways, all I had to do was to wait for the next
    bear market rally to see the new shoreline and get a better execution.

    to shore for the picking. Once a bear market rally starts to recede, price wobbles
    like a career politician. Short sellers are stranded ashore. Optimistic long holders
    have yet to be dragged out to new depths. The line of demarcation is clear. In
    execution trader English, this is a low-risk high-reward entry price with a clear
    stop loss around the top and a probable drop ahead. Wait for the market to roll
    over, then print a new lower swing high along a bearish trend to enter short.
    By the way, this is the mirror entry of the "buy the dips" technique on the long
    side.
  prefs: []

    disproportionately unfavorable probabilities. If you short on breakdowns, just
    remember that 90%+ of market participants will only enter long, and that someone
    somewhere sees the current weakness as an opportunity to buy at a discount. If
    you short bearish stocks as they rally, you might be carried out by a short squeeze
    or the beginning of a bull phase. As a short-seller, there is only a narrow window
    of time when probabilities are in your favor. For this, you need to pay close

    there's no perfect strategy, it's generally best to use a short duration moving
    average, something like closing below the 5-day moving average. Please refer to
    *Chapter 5*, *Regime Definition*, for further information on the moving average
    crossover.

    the previous swing, the less noisy retests tend to be. As a reminder, please see

    few years. There are numerous methods that identify trend exhaustion, such as
    stochastics, RSI, MACD, DeMark indicators, and the latter's ancestor, Fibonacci
    retracements. Most of those techniques boil down to bringing order to chaos. Unfortunately,
    popularity does not necessarily indicate statistical robustness. If you still
    believe in using predictive technical analysis, you could split your order in
    two, where the first tranche uses predictive analysis and the second tranche is
    added upon confirmation that the prediction was accurate. You will have marginally
    better average execution when it works and will not be bankrupted when it does
    not.
