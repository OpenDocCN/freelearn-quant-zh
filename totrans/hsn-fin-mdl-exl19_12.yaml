    While this is one of the indicators that should be considered, it could be a mistake
    to make a decision based solely on that information. As we saw in [Chapter 7](39cefb11-aa19-48d3-a1de-eda9c730b357.xhtml),
    *Cash Flow Statement*, profits do not always equate to cash, and even the most
    profitable company can fold if the profits are not backed up by cash flow.

- en: A ratio is calculated by dividing one item by another—for example, profit divided
    by turnover. However, you should not pick items from financial statements at random
    and divide them; you should select items whose ratio will be meaningful and provide
    information that will aid decision-making. In the example of profit divided by
    turnover, this ratio, otherwise called the profit margin, tells you how much profit
    is generated for every Naira of turnover.

- en: Ratios are usually expressed as percentages, but also as percentages as they
    apply to **times** or **days**. A profit margin of 20% means that after all relevant
    deductions, the company retains 20% of its turnover as profit. In other words,
    the profit for the period is 20% of the turnover. The ratios on their own are
    useful in directing the attention of management and section heads to areas of
    concern; however, it would be more useful if the ratios were calculated over a
    period of time so that a trend could be established.

    investors. Management has access to other internal information not available to
    third parties and can therefore extract more meaning from ratios for the year.
    Investors only have access to the published financial statements. Ratios, which
    are prepared from the financial statements, are therefore of particular significance
    to investors and other external interest groups. The ratios should be calculated
    over a number of years in order to ensure that the results are a true reflection
    of the company's performance. The results can then be compared to similar companies
    and the norm for the industry in which the company operates. They can also be
    used as a basis for forecasting.

    is a gross profit. This means that the direct costs have been covered and there
    is some contribution towards overheads or administrative expenses. The gross profit
    margin will tend to be fairly constant over the years, as it often reflects the
    company's markup policy. If the gross profit margin (or simply the gross margin)
    is very low, or even negative, then it is fair to conclude that the company is
    in trouble. This ratio is of particular importance to management, which sets the
    mark-up policy of the company.

    have seen that there are thousands of ratios, but we have learned that not all

    relative (by comparative measurements) methods of valuation. We will cover the
    concept of the time value of money and use it extensively in our calculations.
    We will learn about several concepts, including free cash flow, the weighted average
    cost of capital, and terminal value, among others.
