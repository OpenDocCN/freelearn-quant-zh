    whose dimensionality corresponds to the number of linearly independent columns
    (assuming there are more observations than features). Two columns are linearly
    dependent when they are perfectly correlated so that one can be computed from
    the other using the linear operations of addition and multiplication.

    different directions or axes and only constitute a single dimension. Similarly,

- en: A manifold is a space that locally resembles Euclidean space. One-dimensional
    manifolds include lines and circles (but not screenshots of eight, due to the
    crossing point). The manifold hypothesis maintains that high-dimensional data
    often resides in a lower-dimensional space that, if identified, permits a faithful

- en: Dimensionality reduction thus compresses the data by finding a different, smaller
    set of variables that capture what matters most in the original features to minimize
    the loss of information. Compression helps counter the curse of dimensionality,

- en: The key idea of hierarchical risk parity is to use hierarchical clustering on
    the covariance matrix in order to be able to group assets with similar correlations
    together, and reduce the number of degrees of freedom by only considering similar
    assets as substitutes when constructing the portfolio (see notebook and Python
    files in the `hierarchical_risk_parity` subfolder for details).
