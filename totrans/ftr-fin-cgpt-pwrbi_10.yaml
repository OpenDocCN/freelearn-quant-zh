    we offer a meticulously crafted dashboard overview featuring a time series plot
    for price movements, an open positions table to keep track of your contracts,
    and a risk analysis chart to assess potential profit or loss scenarios. Next,
    we introduce the invaluable concept of alerts, focusing on the CrowdStrike put
    option, to ensure you never miss an opportune moment to act. Lastly, we add the
    integration with ChatGPT, where you can ask questions directly and receive data-driven
    insights and advice. This section will provide a quick overview of the aggressive
    and conservative trades highlighted earlier in this chapter. It will provide some
    suggestions for visualizing the data in Power BI and turning on Power BI alerts.
    To create these Power BI visualizations, we’ll start by creating CSV files that
    contain the aggressive and conservative trade data starting on page 18-22 and
    then detailed Power BI visualization steps will start on page 22.
