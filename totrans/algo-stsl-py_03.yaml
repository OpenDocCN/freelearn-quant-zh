    all come across some stock they have analyzed, concluded it was doomed to fail,
    and wished they could short it. Then, they watched it crater. They feel confident
    their analytical superpowers would work wonders on the short side as well. It
    all works well in theory until it has to work in practice. When market participants
    come to the world of short selling, they assume they should simply do the opposite
    of what they do on the long side.

    We consider why most traders think they can sell short yet fail in practice. First,
    we will look at why shorting on valuations fails. Then, we will eviscerate the
    structural short tourist trap for good. We will meander in the purgatory of learned
    helplessness, before waking to the reality of short selling. In the second part
    of this chapter, we will start to dive into the world of short selling and its
    unique idiosyncrasies.

- en: On the long side, market participants often look for stocks with solid long-term
    prospects that are temporarily mispriced. They want to buy something that grows
    at a discount, the famous "margin of safety." This approach is known as **Growth
    At a Reasonable Price** (**GARP**). If that seems to work fine on the long side,
    then do the opposite on the short side and voila, right? It could even sound something
    like **Dive at a Record Price** (**DARP**).

    There is always a stock, sometimes an entire industry, that seems to defy the
    conventional laws of gravity. With monetary authorities around the world asleep
    on the "print" button, there is no shortage of absurdly priced stocks. The second
    step is to do some analysis on esoteric business models, sustainability of growth
    rate, cash flow burn rate, and so on. Once the stars align and you spot levitating
    valuations coupled with a sinking business model, it is time to teach manners
    to those insolent stocks with some carefully crafted short positions. Past a certain
    point, no matter how good business models might be, valuations stop making sense
    and things should revert to fair anyway.'
  id: totrans-18

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite the apparent logic of this approach, let's consider why this might not
    be the case. The concept of GARP implicitly relies on fairness. Cheap valuations
    revert to fair. The objective is to catch stocks when they are cheap and ride
    the correction up. For technically versed market participants, buy deeply oversold
    stocks and wait for the rebound. It is fair and makes logical sense. It would
    therefore be fair and logical to assume that unsustainable pricing would revert
    down to fair valuation. The problem is that carrying this subconscious belief
    in fairness into the short world proves to be a fatal virtue.

  zh: 尽管这种方法表面上似乎合乎逻辑，让我们考虑一下为什么可能不是这样。GARP的概念隐含地依赖于公平。廉价的估值会回归到公平。目标是在股票便宜时抓住它们，并在修正行情上赚取利润。对于技术娴熟的市场参与者来说，买入大幅超卖的股票，然后等待反弹是公平且合乎逻辑的。因此，假设不可持续的定价会回归到公平估值是公平和合乎逻辑的。问题在于，将这种对公平的潜意识信仰带入短期世界证明是一个致命的优点。

    to push to the ionosphere, before gravity reels them back in. Stocks with a **Price/Earnings**
    (**PE**) ratio (a valuation metric calculated as share price divided by earnings

    enough evidence to conclude beyond the shadow of a doubt that they have encountered
    a structural short, institutional long holders have already left the building.
    The only shareholders left are stable long-term investors, such as founders and
    strategic partners. Short selling "structural shorts" becomes a binary event.

- en: Besides, short selling is a bit more complicated than long buying. Short sellers
    need to sell stock they do not own in the first place. So, they conveniently borrow
    them from stock lending desks, who charge a lending fee. Lending fees are a direct
    function of supply and demand. They go from general collateral 0.25%-0.5% to double-digits
    for hard-to-locate issues. Structural shorts happen to be also referred to as
    crowded shorts, the lending fee for which would make Shakespeare's Shylock blush
    with envy. Share price may go down but borrowing is prohibitively expensive, and
    any bit of buying pressure triggers a vicious short squeeze, where you might find
    that you've made 1-2% over 2 months, only for stock price to rally 15% in 3 days.

    long side, there is more of something that works and less of something that doesn't.
    On the short side, however, there is less of something that works and more of
    something that doesn't. Even though the absolute movement on each of the shorted
    stocks (C and D) equals the absolute movement of the long positions (A and B),
    the net exposure naturally moves up. Successful longs expand and shorts contract.
    This results in a natural healthy upward drift of the net exposure. This means
    that long and short exposures are not matched.
