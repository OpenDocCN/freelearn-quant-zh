    by a model, entry/leave rules, position limits, and further key properties. We
    have demonstrated how easy it is in Zipline and PyFolio to set up a complete backtesting
    and risk analysis/position analysis system, so that you can focus on the development
    of your strategies, rather than wasting your time on the infrastructure.
