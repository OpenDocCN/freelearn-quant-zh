    and 90% of the information transmitted to the brain is visual. As such, visualizations
    harness this power, translating intricate patterns within raw data into something

    bias, we provide the necessary tools for developing more fair, reliable, and ethically-sound

    risks. An AI model is considered biased when it systematically and unfairly discriminates
