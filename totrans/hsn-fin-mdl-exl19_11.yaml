  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is widely accepted that the most accurate way to value an enterprise is by
    absolute valuation using the **discounted cash flow** (**DCF**) method. Crucially,
    this method considers the time value of money. It also considers the cash flow
    throughout the projected life of the enterprise. This adheres closely to the definition
    of an enterprise's worth as the total amount of cash flow it can generate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The DCF method includes technical concepts and calculations. We will attempt
    to simplify those concepts, but nevertheless, you will not have to repeat most
    of the complex computations required to derive some of the parameters necessary
    for the valuation. There will always be resources available for you to refer to,
    and you will certainly create your own database of resources, which you can tap
    as required.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The DCF method continues from where the 3-statement method ends. It begins with
    the concept of **free cash flow** or **FCF**. The goal is to determine the cash
    flow generated by the company; however, you need to recognize that some of the
    cash generated is committed **inter alia** to satisfying the debt holders and
    capital expenditure plans. We will therefore need to adjust the cash generated
    for these items in order to arrive at the FCF. Generally, you would calculate
    the free cash flow to the firm or enterprise as a whole (FCFF) and adjust this
    to arrive at the figure of the free cash flow to the equity holders (FCFE).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first, FCFF, will lead us to the **enterprise value** (**EV**) and the second,
    FCFE, will lead us to the share price for the company's ordinary shares. Much
    like the cash flow statement, you will start with the operating profit, **earnings
    before interest and tax** (**EBIT**). As taxation by the government is an obligation,
    you need to deduct taxation at the ruling tax rate.

- en: You then add back items that do not involve the movement of funds, such as depreciation.
    An increase in working capital signifies a net outflow of cash that should be
    deducted. If it shows a decrease in working capital, signifying a net inflow of
    cash, then that should be added to your total. Finally, deduct any planned **capital
    expenditure** (**CapEx**) and increase in **work in progress** (**WIP**) to arrive
    at the figure of the free cash flow to the firm, the FCFF.

- en: When a company undertakes a project to build or construct a fixed asset, the
    project sometimes extends beyond the year end. Since, at that stage, the project
    is not yet complete, it would be misleading to allocate the costs incurred so
    far to the asset account. The normal practice is to create a WIP account and post
    all expenditure on unfinished projects to that account. As soon as the projects
    are concluded, the balance on the account is transferred to the appropriate property,
    plant and equipment, or fixed asset account.

    **r** in the discount factor formula. A company typically has different sources
    of capital, debt, and equity, with each source having its own cost or expectation
    of the company. For example, the cost of debt capital would be the interest charge.
    This interest is a charge against the profit for the year, which, along with other
    allowable expenses, reduces the amount of profit subject to tax.

    We have seen that the cost of debt is the interest due to the debt holders. Calculating
    the cost of equity is a more complex exercise. Equity carries more risk than debt,
    and equity holders therefore have a higher expectation of reward. Debt holders
    are assured of their interest as long as the company is a going concern. Equity
    holders have to rely on ordinary dividends, which may or may not be declared.

    For every 1% movement in the market, the shares will also move by 1% in the same

    the market; they carry more risk but also more reward than the market.

    popular among investment analysts. We have seen that there is no one correct answer;

    share price should fall. We have also learned how to create a football field chart

    are kept to a minimum. Nevertheless, since errors are inevitable, we will also
