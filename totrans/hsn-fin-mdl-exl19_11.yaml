  zh: 绝对估值
- en: It is widely accepted that the most accurate way to value an enterprise is by
    absolute valuation using the **discounted cash flow** (**DCF**) method. Crucially,
    this method considers the time value of money. It also considers the cash flow
    throughout the projected life of the enterprise. This adheres closely to the definition
    of an enterprise's worth as the total amount of cash flow it can generate.

- en: The DCF method includes technical concepts and calculations. We will attempt
    to simplify those concepts, but nevertheless, you will not have to repeat most

  zh: 自由现金流
- en: The DCF method continues from where the 3-statement method ends. It begins with
    the concept of **free cash flow** or **FCF**. The goal is to determine the cash
    flow generated by the company; however, you need to recognize that some of the
    cash generated is committed **inter alia** to satisfying the debt holders and
    capital expenditure plans. We will therefore need to adjust the cash generated
    for these items in order to arrive at the FCF. Generally, you would calculate
    the free cash flow to the firm or enterprise as a whole (FCFF) and adjust this
    to arrive at the figure of the free cash flow to the equity holders (FCFE).
  id: totrans-17

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: DCF方法是从三表法结束的地方开始的。它始于**自由现金流**或**FCF**的概念。目标是确定公司产生的现金流量；然而，你需要认识到，产生的现金中有一部分被用于满足债权人和资本支出计划等事项。因此，我们需要调整这些项目的现金以得到FCF。通常，你会计算整个公司（FCFF）的自由现金流，并根据需要调整此数以得到股权持有人（FCFE）的自由现金流数。
- en: The first, FCFF, will lead us to the **enterprise value** (**EV**) and the second,
    FCFE, will lead us to the share price for the company's ordinary shares. Much
    like the cash flow statement, you will start with the operating profit, **earnings
    before interest and tax** (**EBIT**). As taxation by the government is an obligation,
    you need to deduct taxation at the ruling tax rate.

  zh: 第一个，FCFF，将引导我们到**企业价值**（**EV**），第二个，FCFE，将引导我们到公司普通股的股价。就像现金流量表一样，你将从经营利润，即**利息和税前收益**（**EBIT**）开始。由于政府征税是一项义务，你需要按照适用的税率扣除税款。
- en: You then add back items that do not involve the movement of funds, such as depreciation.
    An increase in working capital signifies a net outflow of cash that should be
    deducted. If it shows a decrease in working capital, signifying a net inflow of
    cash, then that should be added to your total. Finally, deduct any planned **capital
    expenditure** (**CapEx**) and increase in **work in progress** (**WIP**) to arrive
    at the figure of the free cash flow to the firm, the FCFF.

  zh: 然后，你要加回不涉及资金流动的项目，如折旧。工作资本的增加表示现金的净流出，应该扣除。如果显示工作资本减少，表示现金的净流入，则应将其添加到你的总额中。最后，扣除任何计划的**资本支出**（**CapEx**）和**工作进展**（**WIP**）的增加，以得到公司的自由现金流量，即FCFF的数额。
- en: When a company undertakes a project to build or construct a fixed asset, the
    project sometimes extends beyond the year end. Since, at that stage, the project
    is not yet complete, it would be misleading to allocate the costs incurred so
    far to the asset account. The normal practice is to create a WIP account and post
    all expenditure on unfinished projects to that account. As soon as the projects
    are concluded, the balance on the account is transferred to the appropriate property,
    plant and equipment, or fixed asset account.

    of capital, debt, and equity, with each source having its own cost or expectation
    of the company. For example, the cost of debt capital would be the interest charge.
    This interest is a charge against the profit for the year, which, along with other
    allowable expenses, reduces the amount of profit subject to tax.

    We have seen that the cost of debt is the interest due to the debt holders. Calculating
    the cost of equity is a more complex exercise. Equity carries more risk than debt,
    and equity holders therefore have a higher expectation of reward. Debt holders
    are assured of their interest as long as the company is a going concern. Equity
    holders have to rely on ordinary dividends, which may or may not be declared.
