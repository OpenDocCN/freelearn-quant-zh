- en: Algorithmic trading relies on computer programs that execute algorithms to automate
    some, or all, elements of a trading strategy. Algorithms are a sequence of steps
    or rules to achieve a goal and can take many forms. In the case of **machine learning**
    (**ML**), algorithms pursue the objective of learning other algorithms, namely
    rules, to achieve a target based on data, such as minimizing a prediction error.

- en: These algorithms encode various activities of a portfolio manager who observes
    market transactions and analyzes relevant data to decide on placing buy or sell
    orders. The sequence of orders defines the portfolio holdings that, over time,
    aim to produce returns that are attractive to the providers of capital, taking
    into account their appetite for risk.

- en: Ultimately, the goal of active investment management consists in achieving alpha,
    that is, returns in excess of the benchmark used for evaluation. The fundamental
    law of active management applies the **information ratio** (**IR**) to express
    the value of active management as the ratio of portfolio returns above the returns
    of a benchmark, usually an index, to the volatility of those returns. It approximates
    the information ratio as the product of the **information coefficient** (**IC**),
    which measures the quality of forecast as their correlation with outcomes, and
    the breadth of a strategy expressed as the square root of the number of bets.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hence, the key to generating alpha is forecasting. Successful predictions, in
    turn, require superior information or a superior ability to process public information.
    Algorithms facilitate optimization throughout the investment process, from asset
    allocation to idea-generation, trade execution, and risk management. The use of
    ML for algorithmic trading, in particular, aims for more efficient use of conventional
    and alternative data, with the goal of producing both better and more actionable
    forecasts, hence improving the value of active management.

    of trade execution to minimize costs as offered by the sell side, but we will
    take a more comprehensive perspective since the use of algorithms, and ML, in
    particular, has come to impact a broader range of activities from idea generation
    and alpha factor design to asset allocation, position sizing, and the testing
    and evaluation of strategies.

- en: If you are reading this, then you are probably aware that ML has become a strategic
    capability in many industries, including the investment industry. The explosion
    of digital data that drives much of the rise of ML is having a particularly powerful
    impact on investing, which already has a long history of using sophisticated models
    to process information. The scope of trading across asset classes implies that
    a vast range of new, alternative data may be relevant in addition to the market
    and fundamental data that used to be the focus of the analytical efforts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may have also come across the insight that the successful application of
    ML or data science requires the integration of statistical knowledge, computational
    skills, and domain expertise at the individual or team level. In other words,
    it is essential to ask the right questions, identify and understand the data that
    may provide the answers, deploy a broad range of tools to obtain results, and
    interpret them in a way that leads to the right decisions.

    extremely low latency in the microsecond range and where participants hold positions
    for very short periods. The goal is to detect and exploit inefficiencies in the
    market microstructure, the institutional infrastructure of trading venues. HFT
    has grown substantially over the past ten years and is estimated to make up roughly
    55% of trading volume in US equity markets and about 40% in European equity markets.
    HFT has also grown in futures markets to roughly 80% of foreign-exchange futures
    volumes and two-thirds of both interest rate and Treasury 10 year futures volumes
    (FAS 2016).

- en: HFT strategies aim to earn small profits per trade using passive or aggressive
    strategies. Passive strategies include arbitrage trading to profit from very small
    price differentials for the same asset, or its derivatives, traded on different
    venues. Aggressive strategies include order anticipation or momentum ignition.
    Order anticipation, also known as **liquidity detection**, involves algorithms
    that submit small exploratory orders to detect hidden liquidity from large institutional
    investors and trade ahead of a large order to benefit from subsequent price movements.
    Momentum ignition implies an algorithm executing and canceling a series of orders
    to spoof other HFT algorithms into buying (or selling) more aggressively and benefit
    from the resulting price changes.

    and the sudden crash by over 1,000 points of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
    on August 24, 2015\. At the same time, market liquidity has increased with trading
    volumes due to the presence of HFT, which has lowered overall transaction costs.

    and systematic sources of risk for a given asset. Idiosyncratic risk can be eliminated
    through diversification, but systematic risk cannot. In the early 1960s, the **Capital
    Asset Pricing Model** (**CAPM**) identified a single factor driving all asset
    returns: the return on the market portfolio in excess of T-bills. The market portfolio
    consisted of all tradable securities, weighted by their market value. The systematic
    exposure of an asset to the market is measured by beta, which is the correlation
    between the returns of the asset and the market portfolio.'

    but rather how it moves relative to other assets, and the market as a whole, was
    a major conceptual breakthrough. In other words, assets do not earn a risk premium
    because of their specific, idiosyncratic characteristics, but because of their
    exposure to underlying factor risks.

    disproved the CAPM prediction that asset risk premiums depend only on their exposure
    to a single factor measured by the asset's beta. Instead, numerous additional

    or any variable that has historically correlated with future stock returns and

    price securities according to the CAPM so that no other factors should have predictive

    risk premiums compensate for low returns during bad times, or behavioral, where
    agents fail to arbitrage away excess returns.

    rests on small firms systematically outperforming large firms, discovered by Banz
    (1981) and Reinganum (1981). The value effect (Basu 1982) states that firms with
    low valuation metrics outperform. It suggests that firms with low price multiples,
    such as the price-to-earnings or the price-to-book ratios, perform better than
    their more expensive peers (as suggested by the inventors of value investing,
    Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, and popularized by Warren Buffet).

    momentum stocks with similar market risk. Researchers also found that value and

    the market portfolio. In 1976, Stephen Ross proposed arbitrage pricing theory,
    which asserted that investors are compensated for multiple systematic sources
    of risk that cannot be diversified away. The three most important macro factors
    are growth, inflation, and volatility, in addition to productivity, demographic,
    and political risk. In 1992, Eugene Fama and Kenneth French combined the equity
    risk factors' size and value with a market factor into a single model that better
    explained cross-sectional stock returns. They later added a model that also included
    bond risk factors to simultaneously explain returns for both asset classes.

    Value and momentum risk factors, for instance, are negatively correlated, reducing
    the risk and increasing risk-adjusted returns above and beyond the benefit implied
    by the risk factors. Furthermore, using leverage and long-short strategies, factor
    strategies can be combined into market-neutral approaches. The combination of
    long positions in securities exposed to positive risks with underweight or short
    positions in the securities exposed to negative risks allows for the collection
    of dynamic risk premiums.

    but the references will highlight avenues to dive deeper into this important framing
    aspect of algorithmic trading strategies.

    to obtain a robust estimate of its predictive power in environments representative
    of the market regime during which the factor would be used in a strategy. Reliable
    estimates require avoiding numerous methodological and practical pitfalls, including
    the use of data that induces survivorship or look-ahead biases by not reflecting
    realistic PIT information, or the failure to correct for bias due to multiple
    tests on the same data.

    order execution results in portfolio holdings. The risk profiles of individual
    positions interact to create a specific portfolio risk profile. Portfolio management
    involves the optimization of position weights to achieve the desired portfolio
    risk and return a profile that aligns with the overall investment objectives.
    This process is highly dynamic to incorporate continuously-evolving market data.

    dilemma: fast execution tends to drive up costs due to market impact, whereas
    slow execution may create implementation shortfall when the realized price deviates
    from the price that prevailed when the decision was taken. Risk management occurs
    throughout the portfolio-management process to adjust holdings or assume hedges,
    depending on observed or predicted changes in the market environment that impact
    the portfolio risk profile.'

    arbitrage. Behavioral algorithms usually operate in lower liquidity environments

    historical patterns, whereas more sophisticated algorithms take into account transaction
    costs, implementation shortfall or predicted price movements. These algorithms
    can operate at the security or portfolio level, for example, to implement multileg
