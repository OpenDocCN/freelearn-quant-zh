- en: '*Mastering R for Quantitative Finance* is a sequel of our previous volume titled
    *Introduction to R for Quantitative Finance*, and it is intended for those willing
    to learn to use R''s capabilities for building models in Quantitative Finance
    at a more advanced level. In this book, we will cover new topics in empirical
    finance (chapters 1-4), financial engineering (chapters 5-7), optimization of
    trading strategies (chapters 8-10), and bank management (chapters 11-13).'

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Time Series Analysis"), *Time Series Analysis*
    (Tamás Vadász) discusses some important concepts such as cointegration (structural),
    vector autoregressive models, impulse-response functions, volatility modeling
    with asymmetric GARCH models, and news impact curves.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Factor Models"), *Factor Models* (Barbara
    Dömötör, Kata Váradi, Ferenc Illés) presents how a multifactor model can be built
    and implemented. With the help of a principal component analysis, five independent
    factors that explain asset returns are identified. For illustration, the Fama
    and French model is also reproduced on a real market dataset.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Forecasting Volume"), *Forecasting Volume*
    (Balázs Árpád Szűcs, Ferenc Illés) covers an intraday volume forecasting model
    and its implementation in R using data from the DJIA index. The model uses turnover
    instead of volume, separates seasonal components (U shape) from dynamic components,
    and forecasts these two individually.'

    – Advanced Analytics* (Júlia Molnár, Ferenc Illés) applies R to access data from
    open sources, and performs various analyses on a large dataset. For illustration,
    K-means clustering and linear regression models are applied to big data.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. FX Derivatives"), *FX Derivatives* (Péter
    Medvegyev, Ágnes Vidovics-Dancs, Ferenc Illés) generalizes the Black-Scholes model
    for derivative pricing. The Margrabe formula, which is an extension of the Black-Scholes
    model, is programmed to price stock options, currency options, exchange options,
    and quanto options.'

    Rate Derivatives and Models* (Péter Medvegyev, Ágnes Vidovics-Dancs, Ferenc Illés)
    provides an overview of interest rate models and interest rate derivatives. The
    Black model is used to price caps and caplets; besides this, interest rate models
    such as the Vasicek and CIR model are also presented.'

    Márkus, Ferenc Illés) introduces exotic options, explains their linkage to plain
    vanilla options, and presents the estimation of their Greeks for any derivative
    pricing function. A particular exotic option, the Double-No-Touch (DNT) binary
    option, is examined in more details.'

    Dömötör, Kata Váradi, Ferenc Illés) analyzes some practical problems in hedging
    of derivatives that arise from discrete time rearranging of the portfolio and
    from transaction costs. In order to find the optimal hedging strategy, different
    numerical-optimization algorithms are used.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Fundamental Analysis"), *Fundamental Analysis*
    (Péter Juhász, Ferenc Illés) investigates how to build an investment strategy
    on fundamental bases. To pick the best yielding shares, on one hand, clusters
    of firms are created according to their past performance, and on the other hand,
    over-performers are separated with the help of decision trees. Based on these,
    stock-selection rules are defined and backtested.'

    Logoptimal Portfolios"), *Technical Analysis, Neural networks, and Logoptimal
    Portfolios* (Ágnes Tuza, Milán Badics, Edina Berlinger, Ferenc Illés) overviews
    technical analysis and some corresponding strategies, like neural networks and
    logoptimal portfolios. Problems of forecasting the price of a single asset (bitcoin),
    optimizing the timing of our trading, and the allocation of the portfolio (NYSE
    stocks) are also investigated in a dynamic setting.'

    and Liability Management* (Dániel Havran, István Margitai) demonstrates how R
    can support the process of asset and liability management in a bank. The focus
    is on data generation, measuring and reporting on interest rate risks, liquidity
    risk management, and the modeling of the behavior of non-maturing deposits.'

    (Gergely Gabler, Ferenc Illés) summarizes the principles of the Basel Accords,
    and in order to determinate the capital adequacy of a bank, calculates value-at-risk
    with the help of the historical, delta-normal, and Monte-Carlo simulation methods.
    Specific issues of credit and operational risk are also covered.'

    concepts and who have some programming skills. However, even if you know the basics
    of Quantitative Finance, or you already have some programming experience in R,
    this book provides you with new revelations. In case you are already an expert
    in one of the topics, this book will get you up and running quickly in the other.
    However, if you wish to take up the rhythm of the chapters perfectly, you need
    to be on an intermediate level in Quantitative Finance, and you also need to have
    a reasonable knowledge in R. Both of these skills can be attained from the first
    volume of the sequel: Introduction to R for Quantitative Finance.'
