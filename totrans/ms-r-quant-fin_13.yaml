- en: One of the main lessons of the current crisis is that some institutions bear
    an outstanding risk for the financial system due to their size or special role.
    During a crisis, these institutions usually get state aid to prevent the whole
    system from collapsing, which would mean higher costs for the state and the real
    economy as well. One of the best examples is the AIG. Due to its activity on the
    CDS market, the Federal Reserve helped the insurer company to avoid defaulting
    since nobody knew the possible effects of the collapse of the institution.

    on the examination and the regulation of **systemically important financial institutions**
    (**SIFI**). To do this, sophisticated identification of SIFIs is getting more
    and more important in financial literature. Expanding the former simple techniques,
    central banks and supervisory authorities tend to use more complicated methodologies
    based on network theory approaches using transaction data of financial markets.
    This information is important for investors as well because it helps to diversify
    their exposure towards the financial sector.

- en: The global financial crisis highlighted that the size of some financial institutions
    was too big compared to the real economy, or they had too many connections with
    important counterparties. Because of this, any problems that affect these institutions
    can have fatal results on the whole financial system and the real economy. For
    this reason, governments spared no effort in saving these institutions. There
    are several global examples where governments or central banks give guarantees,
    inject capital, lend funding, or support the acquisition of their most important
    financial institutions (for example, Northern Rock, AIG, or Bear Stearns).

    would have been accompanied with extreme high costs because of bailouts. All in
    all, identification of systemically important financial institutions again became
    a hot topic. One of the main lessons of the crisis was that the biggest and most
    interconnected institutions have to be handled differently even during normal
    times. According to the new Basel framework, systemically important institutions
    have to be more strictly regulated than their less important partners. Due to
    their central role and their interconnectedness, the failure of these institutions
    can send shock waves through the financial system, which, in turn, can harm the
    real economy. The rational choices of individual institutions, which target the
    maximum possible profit, may be suboptimal on a system-wide level because they
    do not take into account their possible negative effects during stress periods.

- en: Before the crisis, the systemic role of individual financial institutions was
    mainly assessed during the decision about the lender-of-last-resort support. Central
    banks took into account a bank's systemic role in their decision on lending to
    this bank in case of serious problems. A survey about analysis techniques used
    in different countries found that in many cases, authorities applied a similar
    methodology in the assessment of systemic importance. A wide variety of methods
    exist in practice, from traditional techniques (for example, indicator-based approaches
    that focus on market shares) and complex quantitative models to qualitative criteria,
    which include market intelligence (*FSB (2009)*). Several different types of ratios
    might be included in indicator-based methods (*BIS (2011)*). Usually, financial
    markets, financial infrastructure, and financial intermediation are in the focus
    of the examination, but the actual set of indicators can vary from country to
    country, depending on the special characteristics of the investigated banking
    system.

    parts of banking (from assets to liabilities and from notional values of OTC derivatives
    to payments cleared and settled, it may cover several fields, *BIS (2011)*). These
    indicator-based methodologies sometimes don't contain information about the interconnectedness
    of the institution on financial markets. *Daróczi et al. (2013)* provided some
    suggestions on how to include this information in the identification of systemically
    important banks. Simple measures of networks applied for each bank can expand
    the traditional indicator-based methods. In the financial literature, many different
    measures are used to evaluate the stability of the network or assess the role
    of individual institutions. *Iazetta and Manna (2009)* used the so-called geodesic
    frequency (also known as "betweenness") and degree to assess the resilience of
    the network.

- en: Interbank markets are tiered and operate in a hierarchical fashion. It is a
    well-known characteristic of these markets that many banks are dealing with only
    a small number of big institutions, while these big institutions are acting like
    intermediaries or money-center banks. These big institutions are considered to
    be the core of the network, and the others are the periphery.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many papers focused on this characteristic of real-world networks. For example,
    *Borgatti and Everett (1999)* examined this phenomenon on a network made of citation
    data, and found three journals to be the members of the core. Craig and von Peter
    (2010) used this core/periphery structure for the German interbank market. Their
    findings suggest that bank-specific features help to explain how banks position
    themselves in the interbank market. There is a strong correlation between the
    size and position in the network. As tiering is not random but behavioral, there
    are economic reasons (for example, fixed costs) why the banking system organizes
    itself around a core of money-center banks. This finding also implies that coreness
    can be a good measure of systemic importance.

    part of the matrix is important but the core-periphery part is important as well
    (the upper-right and the lower-left part). They emphasize that all of the core
    banks should have at least one connection with a periphery institution. This characteristic
    means that this periphery bank has no other possibility to be on this market but
    through a core bank. Although it is an important issue, we think that due to possible
    contagious effects, being a core bank in itself can result in systemic importance.

    the case of real-world networks. This is true especially when we also have requirements
    for the core-periphery part of the matrix. For this reason, in the first step,
    we will try to solve the maximum clique problem (for example, by using the Bron-Kerbosch
    algorithm, *Bron and Kerbosch 1973*), and then, in the second step, we will choose
    the result with the lowest average degree in the periphery-periphery part. There
    are many other different methods to make a core-periphery decomposition. Due to
    its simplicity, we have chosen this one.

    connection with each other. A problem in the core might make them unable to access
    the market. On the other side, as the core is completely connected, the contagion
    process might be fast and can reach every bank. All in all, the default of any
    core banks jeopardizes the access of periphery banks to the market and may be

    need the matrix that contains the exposures of the banks to each other on the
    interbank deposit market. Since these transactions are not collateralized, the
    potential losses are the biggest on this market. Second, we need the size of the
    capital buffers for each bank. The possibility of contagious effects can be significantly
    mitigated by a high capital buffer. For this reason, it is always important to
    check what can be considered as a capital buffer. Our opinion is that only the
    capital that exceeds the regulatory minimum should be taken into account in this
    exercise to be as prudent as possible. Third, we need the size of each bank. To
    evaluate the effect of one bank's default, we need the size of infected banks.
    In our example, we use the balance sheet total, but other measures can be used
    as well. The chosen measure has to proxy the effects on the real economy (for
    example, it can be the size of the corporate loan portfolio or the stock of deposits

    which has to be set in the code. In this first run, the LGD was set to 65 percent,
    but it can differ significantly in different cases. For example, if the LGD is
    90 percent, the result will be much worse. Five more banks (their codes are 2,
    8, 11, 16, and 20) will also have a significantly negative effect on the banking
    system in the case of an idiosyncratic shock. However, with a much lower LGD,
    the result will also be milder. For example, if the LGD level is set to 30 percent
    bank number 13 will have the biggest effect on the banking system. However, by
    comparing this to the former examples, this effect will be very limited. 36 percent
    of the banking system will default in this case. Using the 30 percent LGD level,
    only 4 banks will have more than 10 percent effect on the system (*Figure 13.7*).

    `sim` function, it is possible to find out which banks are affected directly by
    the default of an examined bank and which banks are affected in the second or
    third or later step of the simulation. For example, if we want to know what happens
    when bank 15 defaults, we write in the R console the following command: `sim(G,
    13, 0.65)`, where G is the matrix, 13 is the ordinal number of bank number 15,
    and 65 percent is the LGD. As a result, we get figure 13.8\. We sign the bank
    that launches the contagion with a red color. Orange is the color of those institutions
    that are affected directly by the idiosyncratic shock of bank number 15\. Then,
    when the color is lighter, the bank is affected later. Finally, banks with green
    nodes are the survivors. LGD was set at 65 percent in this example. It can be
    seen that the collapse of bank number 15 will result directly the default of five
    other banks (with codes 8, 18, 20, 21, and 36). Then, with the default of these
    banks, many more will also lose their capital. At the end, more than 80 percent
    of the banking system will be in default.'

    interbank exposures taken into account but also the size of the main partners
    and the capital buffer of them. In this case, systemic importance can be a result
    of undercapitalized partners. Or on the contrary, it is possible that a bank with
    many partners and borrowed money won't have any negative effect on the market
    since its direct partners have a high enough capital buffer. Bank number 20 is
    a good example of this. In the core-periphery decomposition, it is definitely
    in the core. However, when we run the `sim` function with a 65 percent LGD, the
    result will be very different. *Figure 13.9* presents that none of the other banks
    will default after its idiosyncratic shock.

- en: The main difficulty of the examination of systemic importance is always its
    huge data need. From this point of view, core-periphery decomposition is an easier
    method because we only need the exposure of the banks on the interbank market.
    Although in many cases this may also result in some difficulty since direct linkages
    between banks are often unknown. However, in the literature, we can find some
    good solutions to fill these gaps, for example, the minimum density approach by
    *Anand et al. (2014)*. Alternatively, there are some other suggestions on how
    to create a network from market data (for example, *Billio et al., 2013*).

    We will give you some ideas on how to interpret the results. The core-periphery
    decomposition focuses only on one market. It implies that being in the core means
    that the bank is important on this market. The importance for the whole banking
    system then depends on the importance of this market. Without this information,
    we might only say that the core banks are important for the operation of the market.

    stability. As a result, we get those banks that may trigger a severe crisis. However,
    it doesn't mean that other banks won't have a crucial effect on the operation
    of the interbank market. A bank that has well-capitalized partners may freeze
    the market without jeopardizing the stability of the whole banking system. On
    the longer horizon, the lack of a well-functioning market will result in ineffective
    liquidity management.

    authorities and central banks since maintaining the stability of the financial
    system is their responsibility. However, this information is important for investors
    as well because it helps to diversify their exposure towards the financial sector.

    help in the identification of systemically important financial institutions. These
    two methods are based on the tools of network theory. The first was focusing only
    on the position of each institution in a financial network. So it doesn't take
    into account the structure of the balance sheet at each institutions. The second
    was a simulation method that took into account some important data on the bank's
    capital position as well. The results of these two methods should be taken into
    account subsequently to get a clear picture.
