    is to be installed first on a computer. You can download the software for free
    and find the installation instructions for all major operating systems at [http://r-project.org](http://r-project.org).
    Although we will not cover advanced topics such as how to use R in Integrated
    Development Environments, there are awesome plugins for Emacs, Eclipse, vi, or
    Notepad++ besides other editors, and we can also highly recommend trying RStudio,
    which is a free and open source IDE dedicated to R.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book is aimed at readers who wish to use R to solve problems in quantitative
    finance. Some familiarity with finance is assumed, but we generally provide the
    financial theory as well. Familiarity with R is not assumed. Those who want to
    get started with R may find this book useful as we don't give a complete overview
    of the R language but show how to use parts of it to solve specific problems.
    Even if you already use R, you will surely be amazed to see the wide range of
    problems that it can be applied to.
