    20th century. As she was enjoying a coffee, she noticed a waiter who could remember
    the orders of all patrons with impressive accuracy. On the way home, she realized
    she had forgotten her scarf and returned to the establishment. However, while
    the waiter could effortlessly memorize all outstanding orders, he did not recall
    seeing her half an hour ago. This led her to a momentous discovery of how our
    brain deals with incomplete tasks. Unfinished business (in this case, a pending
    order) tends to linger on our mind while completed tasks (a customer who has paid
    and left) quickly get forgotten.

    thing you want is to allow small losses to gangrene into full-scale blow-ups.
    Executing a stop loss is never an easy decision. If you look back at all the losses
    along the way, you can safely conclude that nothing catastrophic happened. In
    fact, you are still there, partly because you made those difficult decisions.
    So, next time you hesitate to pull the trigger, tell yourself that it may seem
    difficult now, but you will get over it and feel refreshed by next week.

    The tighter the stop loss, the smaller the distance to the stop loss, therefore
    a bigger position size can be afforded for the same risk budget. This results
    in a large average position size and a low average loss, but a high loss rate.
    Tight stop losses tend to be easily triggered. This also increases trading frequency.
    Failure comes from the accumulation of small losses. For example, if it takes

    the position when it is most vulnerable. Every favorable price move reduces risk.

    loss close to break-even. It does not develop into a full-blown loss as in case

    taken a small exploratory position. You have put a chip on the table, but you
    are not ready to call the market''s bluff just yet. If it correctly detects a
    trend, the initial position can be topped up. If not, losses will be contained.

    Partial Exit Only line. It follows the win rate in a linear fashion. The probability
    of success drops below 50% as the price moves beyond 2R. GE of the sole partial
    exit mechanically turns negative. Note that this partial exit is there solely
    as a visual reference as the remainder is indefinitely open. Trend-following strategies
    generally have a default negative GE. Big moves are rare. Loss control is really
    the only way to ensure long-term GE remains positive.

    target prices at 1.1R, 1.5R, 2R, and 3R. We close 91%, 67%, 50%, and 33%, respectively.
    The remainder is closed. A partial exit significantly improves GE. The 1.1R is
    the most conservative. It has the lowest return potential, but it has a built-in
    robust GE. 1.5R has a higher return potential but a lower residual GE. 2R and
    3R have terminal negative GE in this example. Past a certain point, the remainder
    is akin to a lottery ticket.

    losses are bound to be costly. Closing a trade early cuts its profit potential.
    Meanwhile, a failure will cost a full risk budget. It seems like the trading edge
    is bound to be negative. Besides, scaling out intuitively feels like leaving money

    run risk free. A high-probability early partial exit brings the mode, the peak
    number of trades, to the profit side. With a win rate above 50%, the position
    size could even be supersized using a formula like a **fractional Kelly**, or
    Ralph Vince's **Optimal F**. Optimal F is another powerful position sizing algorithm
    that takes into account the largest drawdown. This warrants big position sizes.

    If you have closed a portion of the position, reduced risk, crystallized some
    profit, and ensured that you will break even on the trade, you will be in a much
    better mental state to weather a bear market rally. In practice, you will probably
    be relieved to finally see a bear market rally to get back in the game and slap
    on another tranche.

    conditions. As such, they have a limited shelf life. Once risk is reduced, keeping
    a trailing stop loss on might trigger a premature exit. The objective of a trailing
    stop loss is only to tilt the P&L distribution closer to break even. Now that
    the remainder runs risk free, you might want to deactivate the trailing stop and
    rely on your fixed stop loss. Volatility is high on the short side. Give some
    wiggle room to the market until it is time to re-enter.

    be vulnerable to volatility shocks. The most conservative version is to place
    the stop loss at the previous cost. Somewhere in between is the "French stop loss."
    Markets go up and down in swing highs and lows. This gives the market some additional
