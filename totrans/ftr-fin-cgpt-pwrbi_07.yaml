    company’s potential accurately, holding on to the shares might make sense. However,
    if the increase is mainly due to short-term changes that might not be sustainable,
    selling the shares could be considered.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Model Performance**: Good-quality data can significantly improve the performance
    of the model. Even with a smaller dataset, if the data is relevant, well-curated,
    and devoid of errors, the model can make more accurate predictions. On the other
    hand, a large dataset with lots of irrelevant or erroneous data can lead the model
    to make incorrect predictions.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Overfitting**: Training a model on a large quantity of low-quality data could
    cause the model to overfit, meaning it might perform well on the training data
    but poorly on new, unseen data. This is because the model learns the noise in
    the data instead of the underlying pattern.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Computational Efficiency**: Training LLMs is computationally expensive and
    time-consuming. Using a smaller, high-quality dataset can reduce training time
    and computational resources, making the process more efficient.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, it’s also important to keep in mind that “quality” and “quantity” are
    not necessarily opposing factors. In an ideal scenario, you’d want a large quantity
    of high-quality data. But given a choice between more data of lower quality and
    less data of higher quality, the latter is generally a safer bet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, techniques such as data augmentation, where you artificially create
    new data based on your existing dataset, can help you balance both aspects. These
    techniques can help increase the quantity of your data without compromising its
    quality, thus enabling your model to learn more robustly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, remember that while having good-quality data is crucial, the effectiveness
    of the model also depends on other factors, such as the architecture of the model,
    the learning algorithm used, the tuning of model parameters, and the computational
    resources available.
