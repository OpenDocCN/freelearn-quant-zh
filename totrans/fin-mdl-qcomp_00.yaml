    planning and knowledge required to minimize risks and costs associated with a
    set of assets. Risk is a significant driver in financial interactions, and events
    such as the 2008 financial crisis have highlighted the importance of stress testing
    banks and insurance companies to prevent systemic market crises from occurring.
    Investors aim to strike a balance between expected returns and risk, and diversifying
    their portfolios is one way to achieve this balance. However, unforeseeable events
    can still occur, and regulators and financial entities must remain vigilant to
    control risks in the financial sector. Although regulators have strengthened their
    interaction with financial entities to prevent such events from happening in the
    future, the complexity of human behavior and financial markets remains a challenge.
    Overall, managing assets and risks is a critical consideration in the financial
    sector, as it impacts the potential return on investment and the stability of
    the entire system. While stress testing and regulatory controls can help mitigate
    risks, ongoing vigilance and preparation are necessary to prevent systemic market

    defined as the net value of an investment fund’s assets, minus its liabilities,
    divided by the number of shares remaining. By projecting the NAV into various
    potential future scenarios, authorities can assess, for instance, the liquidity
    risk impact on investment fund assets. This process demands a comprehensive range
    of metrics, which inevitably places stress on the technology required to traverse
    the full spectrum of necessary scenarios and deliver detailed reports to regulators.

    the actual methods for producing accurate simulations are largely left to practitioners.
    They must determine how to evaluate potential value fluctuations based on specific
    parametrization for their assets. One approach involves the statistical evaluation
    of historical data to identify future trends and fluctuation regimes, considering
    past crises and sudden events as potential, albeit less plausible, options. Exploring
    all these future scenarios necessitates the use of methods such as Monte Carlo
    simulation, a widely adopted technique in this context.

    generated primarily from profits on managed activities, distinguishing them from
    the core services of commercial and retail banks, which focus on deposits, loans,
    and credit generation for the general public and large institutions. Traditionally,
    investment bankers relied on experience and market exposure to determine transaction
    prices. However, the availability of data and technology has allowed investment
    to take place on a much larger scale, with more statistically sound and less human-biased
    outcomes. Consequently, investment banking has been an early adopter of technological

    while also potentially leading to the inconsistent application of company policies
    across different locations. However, localized expertise and personalized interactions
    remain crucial components of customer satisfaction. Overly generalized AI systems
    can disrupt the delicate balance between cost-effective automation and customer
    satisfaction, highlighting the need for tailored solutions.

    to streamline the customer onboarding and identification process. This technology
    gained popularity during the smart banking trend, but several cases of bias emerged
    when dealing with individuals with darker skin tones. Such discriminatory practices
    can significantly damage a financial institution’s reputation, making it crucial
    to address potential biases in AI systems.

    edge in the banking industry. AI offers a powerful solution for delivering tailored
    experiences while maintaining efficiency and cost-effectiveness. However, financial
    institutions must carefully consider the potential pitfalls of AI implementation,
    such as bias and the inconsistent application of company policies, to ensure successful
    integration with existing banking processes. As the financial sector continues
    to embrace AI and ML technologies, it is essential to prioritize both the benefits
    and potential risks associated with these advanced tools. By striking a balance
    between personalization, scalability, and fairness, banks can leverage AI to deliver
    exceptional customer experiences, build trust, and ensure long-term success in
    an ever-evolving market.

    a customer as a fraud committer when this is just a prediction associated with
    a probability of it happening. This requires best practices while training and
    evaluating fraud detection models as the sensibility and specificity of it will
    need to be tuned for proper usage. Luckily, defaulters are a minority in the general
    case, but this also means less evidence is found in the data the entity may have
    available when evaluating this condition within its customer base.

    QML models may help in broadening the scope of the models available for performing
    this task and, in some cases, thanks to the expressivity quantum neural networks

- en: Financial institutions, which encompass a broad spectrum from retail and investment
    banks to insurance providers, play an indispensable role in facilitating transactions
    and risk management. Asset management, a critical function, often employs stress
    testing and regulatory controls to evaluate and mitigate risks associated with
    assets such as money market funds, a process that may be expedited and enhanced
    by quantum computing in the future. Portfolio optimization, another foundational
    aspect of financial services, balances anticipated returns against associated
    risks, increasingly utilizing advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence
    (AI) and machine learning (ML). As these technologies become integral to the investment
    landscape, it is crucial to thoroughly comprehend the implications of such automation.
    The adoption of AI and ML by financial institutions aims not only to enhance customer
    experiences and optimize business operations but also to maintain ethical standards
    and accountability. This technological evolution also presents challenges from
    FinTech start-ups that leverage these technologies, thus underlining the need
    for traditional banks to continuously build customer trust and improve service
    delivery. The ongoing digital transformation of customer interaction channels
    fosters intelligent decision-making and enables natural-language interaction with
    banking processes, thereby improving customer satisfaction. Concurrently, the
    application of AI and ML models must emphasize fairness and unbiasedness alongside
    the pursuit of personalization and efficiency to safeguard institutional reputation.
    Lastly, AI and ML can serve as effective tools for detecting potential fraud within
    the customer base and devising appropriate countermeasures, which necessitates
    adherence to best practices and careful evaluation.
