- en: Algorithmic trading helps you stay ahead of the market by devising strategies
    in quantitative analysis to gain profits and cut losses. This book will help you
    to understand financial theories and execute a range of algorithmic trading strategies
    confidently.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book starts by introducing you to algorithmic trading, the pyfinance ecosystem,
    and Quantopian. You'll then cover algorithmic trading and quantitative analysis
    using Python, and learn how to build algorithmic trading strategies on Quantopian.
    As you advance, you'll gain an in-depth understanding of Python libraries such
    as NumPy and pandas for analyzing financial datasets, and also explore the matplotlib,
    statsmodels, and scikit-learn libraries for advanced analytics. Moving on, you'll
    explore useful financial concepts and theories such as financial statistics, leveraging
    and hedging, and short selling, which will help you understand how financial markets
    operate. Finally, you will discover mathematical models and approaches for analyzing
    and understanding financial time series data.
