    Models*, we focused on models establishing a relationship between the risk measured
    by its beta, the price of financial instruments, and portfolios. The first model,
    CAPM, used an equilibrium approach, while the second, APT, has built on the no-arbitrage
    assumption.

    of fixed income securities with a given risk/reward profile. In other words, portfolio
    managers are aiming at allocating their funds into different fixed income securities,
    in a way that maximizes the expected return of the portfolio while adhering to
    the given investment objectives.

- en: The risks of fixed income securities include credit risk, liquidity risk, and
    market risk among others. The first two can be handled by selecting only securities
    with predetermined default risk, for example, with a minimum credit rating and
    with proper liquidity characteristics. The market risk of a fixed income security
    is generally captured by duration, modified duration, keynote duration, or factor
    duration. All measures of the interest rate risk a fixed income security faces.
    This chapter focuses on the market risk of fixed income securities.

    given a yield curve is: ![Measuring market risk of fixed income securities](img/0933OS_04_01.jpg),
    where *T* is the time until maturity of the security, *CF[t]* is the cash flow
    of the security at time *t*, and *y[t]* is the discount rate of a cash flow to
    be received at time *t*. The market price of the bond will converge to its par
    value as time passes, even if its yield to maturity remains constant. This price
    change is expected, hence it is not considered a risk. Market risk arises from
    the changes in interest rates, which causes reinvestment risk and liquidation
    risk. The first affects the rate at which coupon payments can be reinvested, and
    the second impacts the market price of the bond.'

    a bond's yield to maturity (*y*) and its price *(P*). Since duration relates to
    the change in the yield to maturity of the bond to the associated change in its
    price, it is the most important measure of the bond's interest rate risk. Duration
    is the weighted average maturity of the bond.

    gives a good measure of interest rate sensitivity; therefore, it is generally
    used to immunize portfolios. As using duration assumes a flat yield curve and
    a little parallel shift of the yield curve, the immunized portfolio is constrained
    by these assumptions, and being unaffected will mean that the value of the portfolio
    changes only slightly as yields change.

    will change in the future. Let us assume that a portfolio manager expects rates
    to increase in the near future. As this would have an unfavorable effect on the
    portfolio, the portfolio manager could decide to set the duration of the portfolio
    to zero by entering into forward agreements or interest rate swaps. These instruments
    alter the portfolio's duration and can help in setting the portfolio's duration
    to zero without having to liquidate the entire portfolio.

- en: Convertible bonds are usually issued by firms with low credit rating and high
    growth potential. These firms can lower their interest costs by giving the right
    (but with no obligation), to the bondholder to convert the bond into a specified
    number of shares of common stock of the issuing company. The investor receives
    the potential upside of conversion into equity, while having downside protection
    with cash flows from the bond. The company benefits from the fact that when the
    convertibles are converted, the leverage of the company decreases while the trade-off
    is the stock dilution when the bonds are converted.

    different stages: in-the-money convertible bonds (conversion price < equity price)

    > equity price) convertible bonds show debt-like behavior. Pricing a convertible
