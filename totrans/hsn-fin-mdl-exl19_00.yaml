- en: This book will help you understand financial modeling concepts using Excel,
    and provides you with an overview of the steps you should follow to build an integrated
    financial model. You will explore the design principles, functions, and techniques
    of building models in a practical manner. Starting with the key concepts of Excel,
    such as formulas and functions, you will learn about referencing frameworks and
    other advanced components of Excel for building financial models. Later chapters
    will help you understand your financial projects, build assumptions, and analyze
    historical data to develop data-driven models and functional growth drivers. The
    book takes an intuitive approach to model testing, along with best practices and
    practical use cases.

    Modeling and Excel*, shows you the basic ingredients of a financial model and
    what are my favorite definitions of a financial model. You will also learn about
    the different tools for financial modeling that currently exist in the industry,
    as well as those features of Excel that make it the ideal tool to use in order
    to handle the various needs of a financial model.'

    a Financial Model*, helps you to devise a systematic plan to observe that will
    allow you or any other user to follow the flow from the beginning to the end of
    your model. It will also facilitate the building of your model and provide a useful
    roadmap for troubleshooting any errors or discrepancies that may arise.'

    – Completing Modeling Tasks with a Single Formula*, teaches you the difference
    between formulas and functions. You will learn the functions that make Excel ideal
    for modeling. You will also learn how to combine functions and where to get help
    with constructing your formulas where necessary.'

    Framework in Excel*, shows you what makes Excel come alive. The referencing framework
    is what makes Excel dynamic and enables the creation of integrated financial models.
    A sound knowledge of referencing in Excel can significantly speed up your work
    and is priceless for reducing the amount of boring repetition. You will learn
    in an uncomplicated manner how to use relative, absolute, and mixed referencing.'

    and Building Assumptions*, shows the measure of the importance of this topic,
    because about 75% of your modeling time should be spent on getting to know and
    understanding the project. As mentioned a number of times, there are different
    types of model. Which model you use will depend on the nature and purpose of your
    project, as well as your target audience. When building your assumptions, you
    will need to interview all those in a position to give informed and accurate growth
    projections for the various aspects of the entity''s operations.'

    gearing.'

    Reasonableness and Accuracy*, provides a way to consider a range of alternatives
    to some of our key assumptions. Since we have been careful to format our input
    cells differently, we can quickly identify those inputs that have a significant
    impact on our final result, change them, and see the effect this has on our valuation.
    Finally, we look at the presentation of our results with the help of charts.'
