    things melting faster than the polar ice caps are assets under active management.
    Evolution does not take prisoners. If active managers do not want to go join the
    bluefin tuna on the list of endangered species, then maybe learning to sell short
    would be an invaluable skill to add to their arsenal. As the global financial
    crisis of 2007-2008 showed us, it's crucial for market participants to be capable
    of generating profits not only in bull but also in bear markets. To that end,
    this book will cover the ins and outs of short selling, and develop algorithmic
    strategies to maximize its effectiveness, with the end goal of creating a robust
    investment product that will set you apart from your market competitors.

    art than science. The assumption behind art is the notion of innate talent. Some
    naturals are born gifted. Some aren't, and I am one of those. If talent is innate,
    then we mere mortals have to resign ourselves that we simply do not have it. However,
    talent is often an excuse for laziness. Michael Jordan was not a natural. He was
    thrown out of his basketball team, so he trained and would not go home until he
    landed 100 free throws. Landed 98? Oops. Do it again. This way, skills can be
    developed. The output might look like effortless grace. Yet, it takes craft, hard
    work, perseverance, and something Angela Duckworth calls "**grit**."

    capital, and sent off to trade futures. Decades later, some of these people still
    trade. Were they talented? Maybe some of them had some predisposition, but it
    did not matter. They worked on and at a system, the result of which might have
    looked like art.

    be a random walk. The random walk theory was popularized by Burton Malkiel in
    *A Random Walk Down Wall Street*. It essentially postulates that every financial
    asset has an intrinsic value, yet market prices are hard to accurately predict.
    Randomness routinely throws market participants off. When even the best of the
    best in the business succeed roughly 50% of the time, the only conclusion is that
    randomness cannot be eradicated.

    trader. The trader plays risky hands throughout the night and wins the game. The
    next day, the poker player buys a stock the trader recommended. The trader stops
    out the trade two weeks later, while the gambler forgets about it and doubles
    his money over the next 3 years. For the trader, poker is a hobby, and he won
    the poker night because he knew he could afford more risk. Meanwhile, the poker
    player took calculated risks. He accepted the short-term loss as part of winning
    the long-term game. When the poker player followed the investment tip, he rode
    it through the ups and downs, as he was merely using a disposable asset. On the
    other hand, when the trader closed the same stock and missed the ensuing rally,
    he was executing risk management.

    when a game turns from a hobby to a livelihood, we become more risk-averse.

    standards and unrealistic expectations. In the same way, market participants reject
    good enough ideas because of their own self-limiting belief systems all the time.
    They essentially seek reassurance that their pick will perform as expected by
    applying superfluous filters, but they fail to see that some of those conditions
    are mutually exclusive or unrealistic. As a result, they systematically price
    themselves out of the market and miss all the perfectly fine opportunities passing

    all the bad boxes, except obvious trades are rarely profitable. Conversely, high
    dividend yield value traps are classic examples of false negatives or blind spots.
    Those stocks have cheap valuations and dividend support. They do not participate
    in bull markets. They do not provide adequate support in prolonged bear phases
    either. They are slow-burning underperformers, relegated to the purgatory of forgotten
    issues. The bottom line is, despite all best efforts, some stocks still fail to
    be profitable, on the short and long sides. This is a lot more complex than we
    originally thought. More confusion. Back to the drawing board again.

    It's the same with the markets. A stock might tick all the boxes, but something
    unforeseen or overlooked pops up and you bail. When we focus all our energy on
    stock picking, we try to solve randomness with certainty. Trying harder next time

    stocks underperforming their benchmark have peaked out relative to the index.
    Within the population that has hit a ceiling, there are 100% of the future underperformers
    (which would be our key target for short selling) plus some stocks that will meander
    sideways and go nowhere until they trend again. There is simply no easy way to
    discriminate the former from the latter *a priori*. There are, however, simple
    techniques to deal with freeloaders *a posteriori*. The way to beat randomness
    is not to try and be a better stock picker. The way to beat randomness is to accept
    that at one point or another, you will pick losers and learn how to deal with
    them. People see all those great market wizards for the few picks that worked
    well. They do not look at all the ones that were discarded along the way. We have
    it backward. We want the medal before the race. Great stock pickers should be
    judged on what they choose to keep, rather than the less profitable picks they
    discard along the way.

    take place before the short sale. Short sellers deliver shares they do not own.

    is neither an art form nor a science. Market wizards are not born, nor do they
    need to be supremely intelligent. They are forged in the crucible of adversity.
    The stock market is an infinite, complex, random game. The only way to win this
    game is to stay in it, by adapting your strategy to the market's infinite, complex,
    random nature, and to pick stocks and cut losses accordingly. In the coming chapters,
    we will consider how to incorporate short selling into your trading strategy,
    and implement techniques to improve your success rate and gain expectancy.
