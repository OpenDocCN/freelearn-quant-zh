- en: The financial services industry is facing a severe existential crisis. The only
    things melting faster than the polar ice caps are assets under active management.
    Evolution does not take prisoners. If active managers do not want to go join the
    bluefin tuna on the list of endangered species, then maybe learning to sell short
    would be an invaluable skill to add to their arsenal. As the global financial
    crisis of 2007-2008 showed us, it's crucial for market participants to be capable
    of generating profits not only in bull but also in bear markets. To that end,
    this book will cover the ins and outs of short selling, and develop algorithmic
    strategies to maximize its effectiveness, with the end goal of creating a robust
    investment product that will set you apart from your market competitors.

    the poker night because he knew he could afford more risk. Meanwhile, the poker
    player took calculated risks. He accepted the short-term loss as part of winning
    the long-term game. When the poker player followed the investment tip, he rode
    it through the ups and downs, as he was merely using a disposable asset. On the
    other hand, when the trader closed the same stock and missed the ensuing rally,
    he was executing risk management.

    them. People see all those great market wizards for the few picks that worked
    well. They do not look at all the ones that were discarded along the way. We have
    it backward. We want the medal before the race. Great stock pickers should be
    judged on what they choose to keep, rather than the less profitable picks they
    discard along the way.

  zh: 让我们通过一个实际的例子来说明这个概念。我们都可以同意，相对于指数表现不佳的股票已经达到了顶峰。在达到顶峰的群体中，有 100% 的未来表现不佳者（这将是我们空头卖出的主要目标），还有一些股票将会徘徊不前，直到再次趋势。没有简单的方法来区分前者和后者。然而，有一些简单的技巧来处理"吃白食"者。击败随机性的方法不是试图成为一个更好的选股人。击败随机性的方法是接受在某个时候，你会选到失败者，并学会如何处理他们。人们看到所有那些在市场上表现出色的人只是因为他们在选股时做出了正确的选择。他们没有看到那些在这条道路上被丢弃的不那么赚钱的选择。我们的看法是颠倒的。我们希望在比赛之前就获得奖牌。伟大的选股人应该根据他们选择留下来的东西来评判，而不是根据他们在这条路上丢弃的不那么赚钱的选择。

- en: The mechanics of short selling are deceptively simple. For example, you sell
    a stock at 100, buy it back at 90, and pocket the 10\. It works in **absolute**
    or **relative** to a benchmark. There is only one additional step that needs to
    take place before the short sale. Short sellers deliver shares they do not own.
    So, they borrow those shares from a stock lending desk with their brokerage house
    first. Once they buy the shares back and close the trade, they return those shares.

  zh: 空头卖出的机制看似简单。例如，你以 100 的价格卖出一只股票，以 90 的价格买回，然后获得 10 的利润。它可以绝对或相对于一个基准。在进行空头交易之前只需要进行一个额外的步骤。空头卖家出售他们没有拥有的股票。因此，他们首先从他们的经纪公司的股票借贷台借出这些股票。一旦他们买回股票并平仓，他们就会归还这些股票。
- en: Do not let that simplicity fool you. Due to the infinite, complex, random nature
    of the game that we have considered in this chapter, 90% of market participants
    fail. Of the remaining 10%, fewer than half will ever engage in short selling.
    That is the unapologetic reality of the markets.

  zh: 不要让这种简单性愚弄你。由于我们在本章中考虑的游戏的无限，复杂，随机性质，90% 的市场参与者失败。剩下的 10% 中，不到一半的人会参与空头卖出。这是市场的毫不妥协的现实。

    else, we will end up with the same results, minus one standard deviation for good

- en: If virtually everyone fails on the forgiving abundance of the long side, then
    for you to survive on the merciless aridity of the short side, this book must
    be intentionally different. This book will take you on a road far less traveled.
    You might disagree with parts of it, but you will come out transformed. For example,
    like 100% of the people before you, you will conclude that stock picking is bankrupt.
    You will also get to see for yourself exactly where the money is generated within
    the investment process.

  zh: 摘要
- en: In this chapter, we set the context for the rest of the book. The stock market
    is neither an art form nor a science. Market wizards are not born, nor do they
    need to be supremely intelligent. They are forged in the crucible of adversity.
    The stock market is an infinite, complex, random game. The only way to win this
    game is to stay in it, by adapting your strategy to the market's infinite, complex,
    random nature, and to pick stocks and cut losses accordingly. In the coming chapters,
    we will consider how to incorporate short selling into your trading strategy,
    and implement techniques to improve your success rate and gain expectancy.

  zh: 在本章中，我们为本书的其余部分设定了背景。股票市场既不是艺术形式，也不是科学。市场巫师既不是天生的，也不需要极度聪明。他们是在逆境的熔炉中锻造出来的。股票市场是一个无限、复杂、随机的游戏。赢得这场游戏的唯一方法是留在其中，通过调整你的策略以适应市场的无限、复杂和随机的特性，并相应地挑选股票和削减损失。在接下来的章节中，我们将考虑如何将卖空纳入你的交易策略，并实施技术以提高你的成功率和盈利预期。
- en: Market participants are generally less comfortable selling short than buying
    long. This is down to a number of technical factors, but also because of a general
    fear of the practice, propagated by the number of myths related to short selling.
    We will discuss and disprove these in the next chapter.

  zh: 市场参与者通常比买入持仓更不愿意卖空。这归因于一些技术因素，也因为人们对卖空的普遍恐惧，这种恐惧是由与卖空相关的许多神话所传播的。我们将在下一章讨论并驳斥这些神话。
