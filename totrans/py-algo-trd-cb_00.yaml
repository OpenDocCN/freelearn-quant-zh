- en: Python is a very popular language that is used to build and execute algorithmic
    trading strategies. If you want to find out how you can build a solid foundation
    in algorithmic trading using Python, this cookbook is here to help.

- en: Starting by setting up the Python environment for trading and connectivity with
    brokers, you'll then learn the important aspects of financial markets. As you
    progress through this algorithmic trading book, you'll learn to fetch financial
    instruments, query and calculate various types of candles and historical data,
    and finally, compute and plot technical indicators. Next, you'll discover how
    to place various types of orders, such as regular, bracket, and cover orders,
    and understand their state transitions. You'll also uncover challenges faced while
    devising and executing powerful algorithmic trading strategies from scratch. Later
    chapters will take you through backtesting, paper trading, and finally real trading
    for the algorithmic strategies that you've created from the ground up. You'll
    even understand how to automate trading and find the right strategy for making
    effective decisions that would otherwise be impossible for human traders.
