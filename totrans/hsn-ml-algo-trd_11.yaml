    made by individual decision trees by combining them into an ensemble that reduces
    the high variance of individual trees. Random forests use bagging, which is short
    for bootstrap aggregation, to introduce random elements into the process of growing
    individual trees.

    each tree is trained on a different but equal-sized random subset of the data
    (with some observations repeating). Random forests also randomly select a subset
    of the features so that both the rows and the columns of the data that are used
    to train each tree are random versions of the original data. The ensemble then
    generates predictions by averaging over the outputs of the individual trees.

    the randomized training process to produce different, uncorrelated prediction
    errors that have a lower variance when aggregated than individual tree predictions.
    In other words, the randomized training aims to decorrelate or diversify the errors
    made by the individual trees so that the ensemble is much less susceptible to
    overfitting, has lower variance, and generalizes better to new data.

    (**ML**) algorithm for ensembles of decision trees that often produces even better
    results. The key difference is that boosting modifies the data that is used to
    train each tree based on the cumulative errors made by the model before adding
    the new tree. In contrast to random forests which train many trees independently
    from each other using different versions of the training set, boosting proceeds
    sequentially using reweighted versions of the data. State-of-the-art boosting

    learners (typically decision trees) into an ensemble. Boosting was initially developed
    for classification problems, but can also be used for regression, and has been
    called one of the most potent learning ideas introduced in the last 20 years (as
    described in *Elements of Statistical Learning* by Trevor Hastie, et al.; see
    GitHub for links to references). Like bagging, it is a general method or metamethod
    that can be applied to many statistical learning models.

    the outputs of many *weak* models (a predictor is called weak when it performs
    just slightly better than random guessing) into a more powerful, that is, boosted
    joint prediction. In general, boosting learns an additive hypothesis, *H[M]*, of
    a form similar to linear regression. However, now each of the *m= 1,..., M* elements
    of the summation is a weak base learner, called *h[t]* that itself requires training. The
    following formula summarizes the approach:'

    random samples of the training data. Boosting, in contrast, proceeds sequentially
    by training the base learners on data that is repeatedly modified to reflect the
    cumulative learning results. The goal is to ensure that the next base learner
    compensates for the shortcomings of the current ensemble. We will see in this
    chapter that boosting algorithms differ in how they define shortcomings. The ensemble
    makes predictions using a weighted average of the predictions of the weak models.

    the performance of weak learners was developed by Robert Schapire and Yoav Freund
    around 1990\. In 1997, a practical solution for classification problems emerged
    in the form of the **adaptive boosting** (**AdaBoost**) algorithm, which won the
    Göedel Prize in 2003\. About another five years later, this algorithm was extended
    to arbitrary objective functions when Leo Breiman (who invented random forests)
    connected the approach to gradient descent, and Jerome Friedman came up with gradient
    boosting in 1999\. Numerous optimized implementations, such as XGBoost, LightGBM,
    and CatBoost, have emerged in recent years and firmly established gradient boosting
    as the go-to solution for structured data.

    learning progress when fitting an additional ensemble member. In particular, AdaBoost changed
    the weights on the training data to reflect the cumulative errors of the current
    ensemble on the training set before fitting a new weak learner. AdaBoost was the
    most accurate classification algorithm at the time, and Leo Breiman referred to
    it as the best off-the-shelf classifier in the world at the 1996 NIPS conference.

    performance guarantees. These guarantees only require sufficient data and a weak
    learner that reliably predicts just better than a random guess. As a result of
    this adaptive method that learns in stages, the development of an accurate ML
    model no longer required accurate performance over the entire feature space. Instead,
    the design of a model could focus on finding weak learners that just outperformed
    a coin flip.

    very deep trees to reduce bias. AdaBoost, in contrast, grows shallow trees as
    weak learners, often producing superior accuracy with stumps—that is, trees formed
    by a single split. The algorithm starts with an equal-weighted training set and
    then successively alters the sample distribution. After each iteration, AdaBoost
    increases the weights of incorrectly classified observations and reduces the weights
    of correctly predicted samples so that subsequent weak learners focus more on
    particularly difficult cases. Once trained, the new decision tree is incorporated
    into the ensemble with a weight that reflects its contribution to reducing the
    training error.

    fast computation, and it can be combined with any method for identifying weak
    learners. Apart from the size of the ensemble, there are no hyperparameters that
    require tuning. AdaBoost is also useful for identifying outliers because the samples
    that receive the highest weights are those that are consistently misclassified
    and inherently ambiguous, which is also typical for outliers.

    was also able to divide weighted training samples into percentile bins to achieve
    a uniform distribution. XGBoost also introduced the ability to handle sparse data
    caused by missing values, frequent zero-gradient statistics, and one-hot encoding,

    to the information gain. LightGBM also uses exclusive feature bundling to combine features

    trees that aimed to address a problem they labeled over-specialization: trees
    added during later iterations tend only to affect the prediction of a few instances
    while making a minor contribution regarding the remaining instances. However,
    the model's out-of-sample performance can suffer, and it may become over-sensitive
    to the contributions of a small number of trees added earlier in the process.

    more accurate deep neural networks where dropouts mute a random fraction of the
    neural connections during the learning process. As a result, nodes in higher layers
    cannot rely on a few connections to pass the information needed for the prediction.
    This method has made a significant contribution to the success of deep neural
    networks for many tasks and has also been used with other learning techniques,
    such as logistic regression, to mute a random share of the features. Random forests
    and stochastic gradient boosting also drop out a random subset of features.

    of individual features to the output of tree ensemble models called **SHapley
    Additive exPlanations**, or **SHAP** values.

    for tree ensembles, such as the ones we looked at earlier, are inconsistent—that
    is, a change in a model that increases the impact of a feature on the output can
    lower the importance values for this feature (see the references on GitHub for
    detailed illustrations of this).

- en: SHAP values unify ideas from collaborative game theory and local explanations,
    and have been shown to be theoretically optimal, consistent, and locally accurate
    based on expectations. Most importantly, Lundberg and Lee have developed an algorithm
    that manages to reduce the complexity of computing these model-agnostic, additive
    feature-attribution methods from *O*(*TLD^M*) to *O*(*TLD*²), where *T* and *M*
    are the number of trees and features, respectively, and *D* and *L* are the maximum
    depth and number of leaves across the trees. This important innovation permits
    the explanation of predictions from previously intractable models with thousands
    of trees and features in a fraction of a second. An open source implementation
    became available in late 2017 and is compatible with XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost,

    to each player in a collaborative game that reflects their contribution to the
    team's success. SHAP values are an adaptation of the game theory concept to tree-based
    models and are calculated for each feature and each sample. They measure how a
    feature contributes to the model output for a given observation. For this reason,
    SHAP values provide differentiated insights into how the impact of a feature varies
    across samples, which is important given the role of interaction effects in these
