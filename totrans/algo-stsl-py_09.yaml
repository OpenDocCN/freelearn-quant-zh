    risk metrics that will unapologetically assess your ability to live to trade another
    day. We considered the Grit Index, which integrates drawdowns (magnitude, frequency,
    and duration). Then, we introduced the common sense ratio, which recaptures risk
    specific to both trend-following and mean reversion strategies. Finally, we looked
    at the system quality number ratio, before combining all three into a combined
    robustness score, which helps assess risk by combining trading frequency and trading
    edge.
