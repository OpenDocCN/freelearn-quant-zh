    without significant market impact, you do not own anything. It owns you. The way
    to approach liquidity on the short side is radically different. On the long side,

    street. After a beating, they don't come back for round two. Nothing captures
    the emotional journey of long market participants more faithfully than the Kübler-Ross
    model. Market participants grieve their losses. Each phase even has a distinctive
    signature on the markets. Interest wanes, and as the pool of market participants
    shrinks, so does liquidity. Early bear markets are a lot more liquid than later-stage
    ones. Short sellers exit into thinner liquidity than they entered.

- en: This limits the investment universe to issues where liquidity is not a problem.
    The resolution of the 2008 great financial crisis got the markets addicted to
    quantitative easing, otherwise known as free money. In layman's terms, monetary
    authorities flooded the world with painkillers to ease the pain of an economic
    crisis. As soon as monetary authorities hint at tapering off, markets spiral down
    in withdrawal, and traders flock to safer, more defensive stocks, which is known
    as "risk-off." This forces monetary cavalry to keep pumping more painkillers into
    the system, which sends all kinds of speculative assets deep into bubble territory.
    When risk is 'on' and traders are looking for riskier stocks with more profit
    potential, small-mid caps are where the action is happening. Meanwhile, on the
    short side, boring blue chips are out of style. Whenever there is no accountability
    for failure, there is no incentive to play safe. When risk is 'off', and market
    participants are investing more defensively, they gravitate toward larger capitalizations,
    where liquidity remains abundant. Reverting the long-small/short-large caps trade
    is not easy. Shorting small caps is a bloody sport. Liquidity evaporates, and
    you can dock a supertanker in the bid/ask spread. So, gains can be wiped out at
    the first squeeze.

  zh: 这将投资范围限制在流动性不是问题的问题上。2008年金融危机的解决使市场上瘾于量化宽松，也就是所谓的免费资金。简而言之，货币当局向世界注入止痛药，以缓解经济危机的痛苦。一旦货币当局暗示要逐渐停止，市场就会在撤资中螺旋下降，交易者会涌向更安全、更防御性更强的股票，这被称为“避险”。这迫使货币骑兵继续向系统注入更多的止痛药，这使得各种投机资产深陷泡沫领域。当风险是“开放的”，交易者正在寻找风险更高、利润潜力更大的股票时，中小市值股票就是行动发生的地方。与此同时，在空头方面，无聊的蓝筹股已经过时。当失败没有责任时，就没有安全玩法的动机。当风险是“关闭的”，市场参与者更多地投资于防御性更强的大型资本化公司，流动性仍然充裕。恢复长期小市值/短期大市值交易并不容易。空头中小市值股票是一项血腥的运动。流动性蒸发了，您可以在买卖价差中停泊一个超大型油轮。因此，利润可能会在第一次挤压时被抹去。

    had a surreal accuracy rate to predict potential short squeezes. All it took was
    a long-only manager to take a minuscule speculative long position. Since the buy/sell
    equilibrium was already out of balance, this would push the price up and flush
    the tourists out. They would frantically cover, which would rapidly morph into
    a short squeeze. At this point, the long-only manager would leisurely exit their
    long position with a comfortable profit. When I realised that this program directly
    hurt my friends back in the hedge fund world, this WMSD was permanently dismantled.

- en: Short selling is an expensive sport. Short sellers are charged borrowing fees.
    These range from **general collateral** (**GC**) on easy-to-borrow issues to prohibitive
    rates on hard-to-borrow or crowded shorts. As borrow gradually gets taken out,
    the quality of the remaining pool deteriorates. Adding to this, hard-to-borrow
    issues do not only fetch usury rates that would make Shakespeare's Shylock blush;
    they are sometimes callable. This means the lenders have the option of withdrawing
    their lending back on short notice. This is referred to as "**recall**." When
    recalls happen, short sellers are left to either locate borrow elsewhere or close
    their positions. Recalls sometimes cause short squeezes.

    更糟糕的是，难以借入的问题不仅仅可以获得高利率，使得莎士比亚的夏洛克都会脸红； 有时它们是可召回的。 这意味着出借人有权选择在短时间内撤回他们的借款。 这被称为“**召回**”。
    当发生召回时，卖空者要么留在别处寻找借款，要么平仓。 召回有时会引发卖空压力。

    before they could make their money back in May 2007\. That was just in time for
    the next dive. In contrast, Mr. Madoff was always open for business. He had only
    2 consecutive down months. Every month was a good month to get in. Such a small
    drawdown duration is statistically improbable. The only market participant who

  zh: 首先，回撤的持续时间：绝不能考验投资者的耐心。从零售投资者到机构资产配置者，每个投资者脑海中都有一个挥之不去的问题：“现在投资还来得及吗？”只有当贪婪或错过机会的恐惧比害怕赔钱更强烈时，他们才会把自己辛苦挣来的积蓄投入使用。在实践中，高峰时期的资金流入往往与牛市的顶峰相一致。那些订阅了“道指涨至36,000点”骗局并在2000年8月冒险投资的幼稚者，在他们在2007年5月收回资金之前，不得不忍受80个连续月的回撤。那正好是下一次暴跌的时间。相比之下，麦道夫先生总是营业。他只有连续两个月的回撤。每个月都是进入市场的好时机。这样短的回撤持续时间在统计学上是不太可能的。唯一接近的市场参与者是传奇人物爱德华·索普，讽刺的是他在丑闻爆发前14年就揭露了麦道夫。
- en: 'Second, the magnitude of drawdowns: Never test the stomach of investors. Once
    in a drawdown, investors worry about how bad this could get. The markets might
    go up by 7% long-term average return, conveniently omitting the abysmal -40-50%
    drawdowns in between. Even though positive returns were not spectacular, the maximum
    drawdown of -1.56% made it look like a risk-free investment. Kahneman-Tversky
    formulated their prospect theory in a much more brilliant way: loss aversion is
    more powerful than profit-seeking. It illustrates a powerful concept: "It does
    not matter how much you make, as long as you don''t lose." Investors could set
    and forget.'

  zh: 第二是回撤的幅度：绝不能考验投资者的胃口。一旦陷入回撤，投资者会担心情况会变得有多糟糕。市场长期平均回报率可能为7%，方便地忽略了其中的-40-50%的巨大回撤。即使正回报并不惊人，-1.56%的最大回撤使其看起来像是一种无风险投资。康尼曼-特沃斯基以更加精彩的方式制定了他们的前景理论：厌恶损失比追求利润更为强大。这说明了一个强大的概念：“你赚多少钱并不重要，只要你不亏损。”投资者可以设定并忘记。
- en: 'Third is the frequency of drawdowns: Never test the nerves of investors. Madoff
    was supposedly up 92% of the time as opposed to 63% for the S&P. S&P had 6 years
    of annual returns above 20%. It also had 4 years of negative double-digit returns.
    In comparison, Madoff''s fraudulent average return was 11.04%. Yet, the compounded
    return of S&P was 200% versus 500% for Madoff.'

  zh: 第三是回撤的频率：绝不能考验投资者的神经。据说麦道夫的表现有92%的时间是赚钱的，而标普指数只有63%。标普指数有6年的年度回报率超过20%。它也有4年的负双位数回报率。相比之下，麦道夫的欺诈平均回报率是11.04%。然而，标普指数的复合回报率是200%，而麦道夫的是500%。
- en: Fourth is semi-correlation (correlation to down months of the S&P Index), or
    the ability to make money in down markets. At 3%, Madoff was allegedly up whenever
    the market was down. That one sealed the deal. Managers who still stand up when
    everyone else is down stand out. Their phones ring off the hook with interested
    investors.

  zh: 第四是半相关性（与标普指数下跌月份的相关性），或者在下跌市场中赚钱的能力。据称，麦道夫的半相关性是3%，即每当市场下跌时他都能赚钱。这就敲定了交易。在所有人都跌倒时仍然屹立不倒的经理们脱颖而出。他们的电话响个不停，有意向的投资者络绎不绝。
- en: In the real world, generating returns like Madoff is statistically improbable.
    However, the closer you get, the more attractive your proposition becomes. If
    you manage to build a product somewhere between Madoff's Holy Grail and a passive
    investment in the index, you will get a serious edge over your competitors.

  zh: 在现实世界中，像麦道夫那样获得回报是统计学上不太可能的。然而，你越接近，你的提议就越具有吸引力。如果你成功地建立了一个介于麦道夫的圣杯和指数被动投资之间的产品，你将比竞争对手更具竞争力。

  zh: 总结
- en: This short chapter is not meant to test the braincells of the reader. It is
    simply a collection of practical tips on how to avoid classic expensive pitfalls
    and meet investors' expectations. Investors do not buy into long/short products
    for long ideas. They want low-volatility uncorrelated returns. This chapter considered
    investors' expectations, while avoiding the trap of thinking of the short book
    as an afterthought of the more fun long book. If those problem stocks are removed
    from your field of vision, they will not be on your mind and this will eliminate
    temptation.

  zh: 这个简短的章节并不意味着要考验读者的脑细胞。它只是一个关于如何避免经典昂贵陷阱并满足投资者期望的实用提示集合。投资者不是为了长期想法而购买多空产品。他们想要低波动性的不相关回报。这一章考虑了投资者的期望，同时避免了将空头书籍视为更有趣的多头书籍的陷阱。如果将那些问题股票从你的视野中清除，它们就不会在你的脑海中出现，这将消除诱惑。

    of you by investors, it is time to pull the trigger. In the next chapters, we
    will put everything together, and see how this can be done in practice.
